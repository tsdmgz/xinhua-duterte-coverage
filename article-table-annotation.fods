     <table:table-cell table:style-name="ce10" office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p> </text:p><text:p>    MANILA, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- The leftist New People&apos;s Army (NPA) on Tuesday released an Army junior officer, who was abducted by the rebels about two months ago following a fierce firefight in the southern province of Compostela Valley, the Philippine military said. </text:p><text:p>    Lt. Vicente Cammayo was released by the rebels to Davao City vice mayor Sarah Duterte Tuesday morning in the Agusan del Sur province, said Ernesto Torres, spokesman of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. </text:p><text:p>    Cammayo was later brought to the headquarters of the military’s Eastern Mindanao Command in Davao City for debriefing, Torres said. He was taken as a prisoner of war on Nov. 7 last year in a clash that also left two soldiers and a rebel dead. </text:p><text:p>    &quot;The release of Lt. Cammayo is a result of the concerted efforts of the local government officials, family of Lt. Cammayo and the security forces in the area,&quot; said the spokesman. </text:p><text:p>    The local officials negotiated for Cammayo&apos;s release while the military applied pressure by waging rescue operations to recover the officer. </text:p><text:p>    Torres said the military was not involved in the negotiations for the soldier&apos;s freedom. </text:p><text:p>    &quot;We maintain that the military was not involved in any negotiations, but rather an intensified rescue operation mission has been mapped out upon his abduction,&quot; he said. </text:p><text:p>    At the same time, the official said that there was no reason for the military establishment to be grateful with the left-wing rebels over the release of Cammayo, adding that the abduction itself is against the law and the rebels should be held accountable for it. </text:p><text:p>    &quot;There is no reason for anybody to be grateful to the NPA for the release of Lt. Cammayo. The release of Lt. Cammayo is not an act of goodwill. Being a clear criminal act, those who are behind the abduction must be held responsible under a legitimate justice system and we shall continue our vigorous military operation to pursue the abductors,&quot; said Torres. </text:p><text:p>    The 5,400-strong NPA has been waging a guerrilla war against the government since its founding in late 1960s. It halted peace talks with the government in 2003, irritated by the administration&apos;s inaction to remove it from the U.S. government&apos;s list of international terrorist organizations. </text:p><text:p/>

Malinao</text:p><text:p>MANILA, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- The proposed agreement between Manila and Washington to increase U.S. military presence in the country by allowing American troops to use Philippine bases has been assailed and defended.</text:p><text:p>The militant Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (New Nationalist Alliance) said that the proposal could be &quot;worse&quot; than the military bases agreement that was terminated by the Philippines in l991.</text:p><text:p>Renato Reyes, secretary-general of the alliance, said that the new agreement if signed &quot;will allow U.S. troops to be present all over the country. Every Philippine military facility, not just Subic and Clark, can now be accessed by U.S. troops.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Subic Naval Base in Subic, Zambales and Clark Air Base in Pampanga, both north of Manila, used to be the two largest U.S. military facilities in the region before the abrogation of the military accord with the U.S. two decades ago.</text:p><text:p>But Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario said increased &quot;rotational presence&quot; of the U.S. troops in the Philippines will ensure &quot;the security of our people and the territorial integrity of our nation.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Del Rosario said that aside from security considerations, the expanded U.S. military presence will &quot;vastly improve&quot; the country&apos; s ability to provide Filipinos and the region with timely and responsive humanitarian and disaster relief.</text:p><text:p>Del Rosario also gave the assurance that the agreement will not violate the Philippine Constitution, which among other things, bans the presence of nuclear arms in the country. A number of U.S. warships are known to carry nuclear missiles.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Our Philippine negotiators have been given parameters that require them to ensure that our Constitution and laws are fully respected. They have been tasked to ensure that Philippine interests are preserved and promoted,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>The Department of Foreign Affairs is participating in the negotiations between the defense officials of the two countries. The first round was held in Manila on Monday; the second round will be held in Washington, D.C.</text:p><text:p>Del Rosario said that while the Philippines is steadfastly for peace in the region, it also stands ready &quot;to tap every resource, to call on every alliance, to do what is necessary in order to defend what is ours, to secure our nation and to keep our people safe.&quot;</text:p><text:p>But Reyes said that more than the frequent port calls for refuelling, resupply and recreation, U.S. forces will now be allowed to preposition their weapons and equipment in Philippine military facilities.</text:p><text:p>&quot;This means turning the entire country into a huge U.S. military base,&quot; Reyes said.</text:p><text:p>Reyes said that the Philippine government will have no control over these equipment and vehicles, citing the current Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which does not give the Philippines the right to inspect U.S. war materiel.</text:p><text:p>The negotiation between the Philippines and the United States over the framework agreement on the American forces&apos; increased rotational presence in the Philippines was nothing but a &quot; masquerade&quot;, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) said Wednesday.</text:p><text:p>The leftist rebel group said that the talks which began on Wednesday were just to formalize what has been the U.S. practice of making use of the Philippines as a military base.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The plan to grant the U.S. greater military access to local ports and infrastructure and to extend rights to set up its own facilities has long been agreed upon by the Aquino government and the U.S. military,&quot; said the CPP, the umbrella group of the New People&apos;s Army.</text:p><text:p>This arrangement was clinched in the Strategic Defense Dialogue held in Washington in January 2012 right after U.S. President Barack Obama declared his government&apos;s strategy to pivot toward Asia where it plans to deploy more than half of its naval forces, it said.</text:p><text:p>The CPP reiterated its position that further strengthening and expanding U.S. military presence in the Philippines violate Philippine sovereignty.</text:p><text:p>Senate President Franklin Drilon also urged Philippine negotiators to ensure that the proposed accord would be legal and constitutional.</text:p><text:p>&quot;As a senator, it is my obligation to our people to ensure that any agreement the government will enter into is legal and in accordance with our Constitution. I will examine the outcome of the negotiations to see to it that it will not infringe on the lives of our people and their guaranteed rights,&quot; Drilon said.</text:p><text:p>Drilon said any agreement on increased American presence must be governed by the terms of the VFA and must preclude the possibility of granting permanent basing rights to foreign forces.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The framework agreement should be in accordance with the restrictions set forth under the VFA,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>The VFA that allows limited American military presence in the country was signed in 1991 in lieu of a formal bases agreement.</text:p><text:p>Meanwhile, Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Davao City in southern Philippines revealed that he has rejected a U.S government request to use the city&apos;s old airport as an operating base for its drone program.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The U.S. government wants to use the old airport. I refused. I will not allow them to use our airport for them to launch their drones,&quot; Duterte was quoted as saying Monday by the local media.</text:p><text:p>Duterte, known for being straightforward, said that he does not want his city to be used as a base for unmanned aerial vehicles by the U.S. in its campaign against terrorism and insurgency.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I do not want it. I do not want trouble and killings,&quot; Duterte said.</text:p><text:p>He said he told the U.S. government that there would be more bloodshed if there were drone operators in the city. &quot;They will only add to the problem,&quot; Duterte said.</text:p><text:p>Duterte said that in 2011, he believed the U.S. was engaged in covert operations against Muslim extremists in Davao City.</text:p><text:p> </text:p><text:p/><text:p/>

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>by Alito L. Malinao</text:p><text:p>MANILA, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- If Vice President Jejomar Binay will win in the 2016 presidential elections, he would be the best example of how a political dynasty can control national and local politics in the Philippines.</text:p><text:p>While Binay would be on the top of the Philippine officialdom as president, one of his daughters is a senator, another is a congresswoman, and a son, his namesake, is mayor of Makati, the country&apos;s premier city.</text:p><text:p>The issue of political dynasties is not new in the Philippines and is not limited to the political opposition led by Binay.</text:p><text:p>In fact, incumbent President Benigno Aquino III is a third generation member of a well-known political dynasty. He is the son of the late President Corazon Aquino and the martyred Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr. His grandfather, the late Benigno Aquino, Sr., was one-time speaker of the House of Representatives.</text:p><text:p>Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas, the presumptive opponent of Binay in the 2016 presidential race, is also a third generation politician from a political clan. His late father, Gerry Roxas, was a senator and his grandfather was the first president of the Philippine Republic.</text:p><text:p>The list of the current crop of politicians who are members of political dynasties can go on and on.</text:p><text:p>In the Philippine Senate alone, three are sons of former presidents. The siblings Jinggoy Estrada and J.V. Ejercito are both sons of former President Joseph Estrada, who was ousted by a military-backed civilian uprising after only two years in office.</text:p><text:p>Senator Ferdinand &quot;Bongbong&quot; Marcos is the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. He is rumored to have ambitions to run in the 2016 presidential derby. His mother, the former First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos, now 84, is a congresswoman representing the province of Ilocos Norte in northern Luzon while a sister is the governor of the province.</text:p><text:p>Is there no end to the dominance of family dynasties in Philippine politics?</text:p><text:p>A number of bills have been filed in both houses of Congress precisely to put an end to political dynasties as provided for in the Philippine Constitution.</text:p><text:p>Section 26, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states &quot;The state shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law. &quot;</text:p><text:p>But since l987, the Philippine Congress has failed to enact an enabling law that would implement the constitutional prohibition of political dynasties.</text:p><text:p>In Senate Bill 2649, also known as the Anti-Political Dynasty Act, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago defines a dynasty as a situation when an incumbent official&apos;s spouse or his or her second- degree relatives hold or seek office together, or when a spouse or relative succeeds him or her.</text:p><text:p>Santiago said that her bill would level the playing field of the political arena and would open it to persons who are equally qualified to aspire for government elective posts but who cannot hope to win against well-entrenched politically-dominant families.</text:p><text:p>&quot;In many instances, voters, for convenience and out of cultural mindset, look up to these ruling families as dispensers of favors and thus elect them or their relatives to public office,&quot;Santiago said.</text:p><text:p>Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio has defined political dynasties as a &quot;phenomenon that concentrates political power and public resources within the control of a few families whose members alternately hold elective offices, deftly skirting term limits.&quot;</text:p><text:p>One good example of how politically-entrenched families can circumvent the law is Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Davao City in the southern Philippines. The feisty mayor is known for his extra- legal methods in going after the city&apos;s hoodlums.</text:p><text:p>Under the law, a local official can only hold office for three consecutive terms of three years each. When Duterte&apos;s nine-year term as city mayor ended, he pushed his daughter to run for mayor and he as vice mayor and both of them won. After his daughter&apos;s term as mayor lapsed, Duterte again run for mayor and has since regained his post.</text:p><text:p>Duterte&apos;s case is being replicated in other cities and provinces in the country where members of political dynasties take turn in holding elective posts to the exclusion of other individuals who cannot win an election because of lack of resources.</text:p><text:p>A recent study by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism traced the emergence of political dynasties in the Philippines to the introduction by the Americans of electoral politics in the early 20th century, when voting was initially limited to the rich and the landed, who then monopolized public office.</text:p><text:p>The study said that the motive behind political dynasties is primarily to protect the families&apos; interests in the legislature and executive branches of the government to the detriment of the majority.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Political dynasties are a terrible indictment of the kind of politics we have,&quot; said former Senator Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. &quot;I do not believe that any one family has the monopoly of talent to run the government.&quot;</text:p><text:p>But Pimentel was being dishonest in his observation. His son and namesake, Aquilino Pimentel III, is now a senator of the Republic. </text:p><text:p/><text:p/>

Gregorio Honasan, led 21 other candidates for president to file their certificates of candidacy at the main office of the independent Commission on Elections (Comelec).</text:p><text:p>Among the &quot;early birds,&quot; Binay is the only one who seems to make it to the final list of serious contenders for the position of President Aquino whose six-year term ends in June next near.</text:p><text:p>Under the Philippine constitution, Aquino is barred from seeking another term.</text:p><text:p>Comelec Chairman Andes Bautista said that eventually the so- called &quot;nuisance candidates,&quot; those who have no means to conduct a nationwide campaign, would be removed from the official list of candidates.</text:p><text:p>Aquino has endorsed former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas to be his successor.</text:p><text:p>Roxas, along with Sen.

To them, the 71-year-old mayor embodied the hope of change.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Duterte is a strong-willed leader with outstanding track record in Davao, and he can address the now bad peace and order situation, huge rich-poor gap and rural development and infrastructure needs,&quot; said columnist Wilson Lee Flores.</text:p><text:p>Flores&apos; views are shared by many, but some analysts have warned of danger of blind optimism. They said the presumptive president will bring change to the country, but it is premature to say how big or radical the change may be.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The emotional voters fail to see Duterte has only offered vague and generic promises,&quot; said Richard Heydarian, professor at De La Salle University.</text:p><text:p>Heydarian, also a political adviser, said Duterte has raised public&apos;s expectations so high that he has to find some way to manage them.</text:p><text:p>Duterte became Davao City mayor in the 1980s and has since held the post for seven times.</text:p><text:p>Once notorious as the nation&apos;s &quot;murder capital&quot; in southern Mindanao region, Davao is now one of the country&apos;s safest cities under his rule.</text:p><text:p>During the presidential campaign, Duterte made promises to wipe out corruption, criminality and drugs in three to six months after he takes office.</text:p><text:p>Duterte clearly understands the importance of reassuring the public of his competence in sustaining current economic growth as well as his sophistication in handling multifaceted domestic issues.</text:p><text:p>Prior to the election, investors have expressed concerns over his lack of economic experience.

(Xinhua/Meng Zhongde)</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- It has been widely speculated that the South China Sea will dominate the Shangri-La Dialogue, an Asia-Pacific defense and security summit opened on Friday in Singapore.</text:p><text:p>If so, the three-day meeting, which gathers military brass, intelligence officers and civilian leaders and promises to play a constructive role in regional security, will be another platform hijacked to make a fanfare of the maritime disputes.</text:p><text:p>Around the South China Sea, another negative development is that a few, particularly non-claimants, have been busy expanding presence and flexing military muscles around the South China Sea, as an international arbitration tribunal in The Hague prepares to deliver a ruling in the next few months over a case about the issue unilaterally lodged by Manila in 2013.</text:p><text:p>This adds to the worry that outside interference, which stems from various self-interests, has become an increasingly serious menace to stability in the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>For example, the United States has conducted several so-called &quot;freedom of navigation&quot; operations by closely flying or sailing past South China Sea islands, blatantly violating China&apos;s sovereign and security interests.</text:p><text:p>In the meantime, the U.S. military made a series of harsh rhetoric on the issue. During his speech at the U.S. Naval Academy at the end of last month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the Pentagon&apos;s best weapons will be deployed to the Pacific region.</text:p><text:p>The words and deeds, with an obvious intention to create a volatile situation to help Washington preserve hegemonic presence in the Asia-Pacific region, will embolden certain claimants to make hot-headed moves on the issue.</text:p><text:p>These claimants should be reminded that if a confrontation between the United States and China whose sovereignty over the South China Sea islands is backed by both legal and historical facts should take place, regional countries will face a Cold War dilemma of picking sides between the world&apos;s two largest economies. To avoid such agony, they should be work together for common development and prosperity.</text:p><text:p>In fact, before the recent disturbances struck, the South China Sea situation had been generally peaceful thanks to Beijing&apos;s exercise of restraint and concerted efforts of most countries in the region.</text:p><text:p>Despite the territorial rows between China and other claimants, freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea has never been a problem. China also views the waters as being vital to global trade and its own development.</text:p><text:p>The good old time has proven that Beijing and other claimants, whose security and development interests are intensely interwoven, are capable of settling the disputes by themselves.</text:p><text:p>Successive leaders of claimant countries have agreed in their meetings and political documents that the South China Sea disputes should be resolved peacefully through direct negotiations. This stance is also stated in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>What&apos;s heartening is that some positive signs have appeared.

(Xinhua/Xing Guangli)</text:p><text:p>BUENOS AIRES, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines&apos; ongoing maritime dispute with China over the South China Sea must be resolved through reasoned bilateral dialogue, said a leading Argentine economist and academic.</text:p><text:p>Unilateral measures only serve to damage the relationship between the two countries, Gustavo Girado, head of the Buenos Aires-based Asia &amp; Argentina Consultancy, told Xinhua in a recent interview.</text:p><text:p>In 2013, Manila decided to take its case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, a move that &quot;didn&apos;t seem to be the most appropriate, since the decade-old agreements between the two countries have established a proper means to resolve their disputes,&quot; said Girado.</text:p><text:p>The unilateral move ran counter to the commitments the Philippines made as a signatory of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), said the academic.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The road the Philippines chose draws attention somewhat due to a number of factors which failed to justify that action, historic and political factors,&quot; said Girado.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It&apos;s very clear that Chinese inhabitants were the first to name the region,&quot; he added.</text:p><text:p>On Wednesday, China again urged the Philippines to suspend its legal proceedings at the PCA and return to the negotiating table.</text:p><text:p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei made the remarks at a press conference, saying the door to bilateral talks will always be open.</text:p><text:p>&quot;China will continue to be committed to a negotiated solution to the South China Sea dispute with the Philippines, based on historic facts and in accord with international law,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Girado believes the dispute &quot;doesn&apos;t merit intervention by third parties,&quot; such as an arbitration court, which &quot;belongs to the last century.&quot;</text:p><text:p>In 2014, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a Position Paper on the arbitration, saying that the essence of the subject matter of the case is territorial sovereignty over several maritime features in the South China Sea, which is beyond the scope of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) under which Manila initiated the arbitration.</text:p><text:p>China has repeatedly noted that since the 1970s, the Philippines has illegally seized by force maritime features of China&apos;s Nansha Islands in disregard of the UN Charter and the basic norms governing international relations, and this is &quot;the root and direct cause&quot; of the two countries&apos; disputes over the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It&apos;s appropriate for China not to take into consideration the resolution of arbitration, given the previous accord that allows for reaching a mutual agreement through peaceful, responsible negotiation,&quot; Girado said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Law of the Sea legislation precisely says that those who have a previous accord for bilateral resolution of disputes must take that route,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>With that in mind, said the academic, it seems &quot;clear and wise on the part of Chinese diplomacy not to take into account any eventual decision (issued by the PCA), because it doesn&apos;t take into account China&apos;s opinion.&quot;</text:p><text:p>As to the likelihood of outside powers intervening in the dispute, Girado thought it&apos;s &quot;evident.&quot; He explained that since U.S. President Barack Obama&apos;s first term, a policy has been established for the region, with the U.S. Navy&apos;s presence in a certain area in order to exert a degree of influence on matters of interest to the United States.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It&apos;s a tremendously rich zone, through which half of the planet&apos;s maritime mercantile trade passes. I have no doubt there are concrete interests at play in the Filipino decision, which really calls one&apos;s attention,&quot; said Girado.</text:p><text:p>The academic underscored the need for a negotiated solution to the dispute, drawing parallels to Argentina&apos;s long-running conflict with Britain over the Malvinas Islands, known to the British as the Falklands.</text:p><text:p>Since the islands &quot;were usurped by the world&apos;s leading capitalist economy back in the year 1833, different interests have been at play to prevent Argentina, a developing country, from staking a claim to what belongs to it.&quot;</text:p><text:p>In early June, China said it hoped the new government in the Philippines would return to the negotiating table.</text:p><text:p>After the Philippines&apos; incoming Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay signalled that bilateral talks with China could help deescalate the dispute, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying noted that successive leaders from both sides have agreed in past meetings and documents to resolve the issue peacefully through direct talks.</text:p><text:p>&quot;We hope the new government of the Philippines fulfills its pledges and resumes talks with China to properly handle disputes in a way that contributes to the sound and stable development of bilateral ties,&quot; said Hua.</text:p><text:p>The incoming president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has said he wants to promote friendly ties with China and that he is open to direct talks on the South China Sea dispute. </text:p><text:p>Related:</text:p><text:p>Spotlight: Experts say China&apos;s stance on South China Sea arbitration fully justified</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines&apos; unilateral move to bring a maritime dispute with China to an international tribunal won&apos;t help resolve the problem and the right way forward is to seek settlement through bilateral talks, several foreign experts told Xinhua in recent interviews.  Full story</text:p><text:p>Interview: Manila intensifies tension in South China Sea -- former diplomat</text:p><text:p>MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has been behind the intensifying tensions in the South China Sea, a former diplomat of the country told Xinhua on Wednesday.</text:p><text:p>Alberto Encomienda, former secretary-general of Maritime and Ocean Affairs Center of the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department, said: &quot;China has been for the negotiations all along, but from the beginning we are not.&quot; Full story</text:p><text:p/>

(Xinhua/Xing Guangli)</text:p><text:p>MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine experts on Monday urged incoming president Rodrigo Duterte to proceed with direct talks with China on the South China Sea immediately, saying the new administration need not wait for the decision of a tribunal to kick-start the talks.</text:p><text:p>Rod Kapunan, a columnist for the newspaper The Standard, said it may not be wise for the incoming Duterte administration to wait for a decision from an tribunal in The Hague which China will not recognize anyway.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Once the court comes out with a decision, our position to reach a direct and peaceful settlement of our dispute with China would become more difficult,&quot; Kapunan told Xinhua in an interview.</text:p><text:p>&quot;China has always been open for direct and peaceful negotiations but the conditions will not be the same after the decision,&quot; he said, warning that the decision might even force Beijing to stay away from the negotiating table.</text:p><text:p>&quot;If you are going to negotiate directly and peacefully with China after the arbitration decision comes out, China will surely insist that there must be no reference to the court&apos;s decision,&quot; Kapunan said.</text:p><text:p>In 2013, the Philippines initiated an arbitration case against China over the South China Sea. China, which has declined to take part in the process, has said it will not recognize the court&apos;s decision.</text:p><text:p>For the direct talks to take off, Kapunan said the Duterte administration must scrap its Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) signed by the Philippines and the United States in 2014.</text:p><text:p>The expert also said that this pact &quot;locks the Philippines in a situation where we would be permanently girding for war with China&quot; and adopt a foreign policy that unmistakably serves the interest of the U.S. in the Asia and the Pacific.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The best solution is first to scrap the EDCA and second to start the direct talks,&quot; said Kapunan, adding that EDCA stands in the way &quot;like a wall&quot; between the Philippines and China.</text:p><text:p>&quot;For as long as we have foreign military bases in our soil, the country can never formulate its own independent foreign policy,&quot; Kapunan said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;As a lawyer, Duterte could see the implication in allowing the re-installation of the U.S. bases. Other than providing no time limit for the American&apos;s stay, the agreement gave the U.S. the blanket authority to select the place and the number with a premium that our Senate would have to ratify it as mandated by our Constitution,&quot; Kapunan added.</text:p><text:p>Indeed, Kapunan said, &quot;The abrogation of EDCA is the easiest way (for the Duterte administration) to escape the dilemma.&quot;</text:p><text:p>He said, &quot;President Benigno Aquino III knew that by bringing our dispute with China to the PCA (the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague) would give the U.S. the leverage to continue its provocative patrol in the South China Sea.&quot;</text:p><text:p>By doing that, &quot;the perception about the naval presence of the U.S. in the South China Sea can never be doubted because the Philippines being strategically adjacent to China would forever seek the protective cover of the U.S.. In short, all these could lead the country to a possible proxy war with China,&quot; Kapunan said.</text:p><text:p>This explains why, Kapunan said, Duterte would have difficulty redrawing the foreign policy under his administration.</text:p><text:p>He further said, &quot;A decision to disallow the U.S. bases or to unilaterally drop the case could antagonize the U.S. because that would explode its continued presence in the South China Sea redundant. Nobody would believe that its continued patrol in the area is to secure the freedom of navigation. Rather, the whole military infrastructure it build would be exposed as a facade to contain China.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Indeed, retired diplomat Alberto Encomienda told Xinhua in another interview that the new Duterte administration should proceed with talks with China on the sea disputes.</text:p><text:p>&quot;You don&apos;t have to wait for the resolution of the arbitration case before starting conversations. You don&apos;t have to finish that arbitration. Nobody even knows when that will be finished,&quot; Encomienda said.</text:p><text:p>Assistant Foreign Secretary Charles Jose has repeatedly said that the Philippines will really have to go back to bilateral talks, though he pins hope on the arbitration court handing down a favorable decision.</text:p><text:p>In a television interview Monday, Jose said, &quot;we are now in the tail-end of the arbitration process.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Duterte, who will be sworn into office on June 30, has said he would wait for the final decision of the court, but at the same time said that he will pursue bilateral talks with China if current efforts do not progress. He even said that he might explore possible joint exploration in the disputed South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>Duterte also said that the Philippines is not going to give up its rights to the Scarborough Shoal, or Huangyan Island.</text:p><text:p>But before 1997, the Philippines had never claimed sovereignty over Huangyan Island, and the international community had never raised any objection to China&apos;s sovereignty over the island as well. </text:p><text:p>Related:</text:p><text:p>Spotlight: Experts say China&apos;s stance on South China Sea arbitration fully justified</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines&apos; unilateral move to bring a maritime dispute with China to an international tribunal won&apos;t help resolve the problem and the right way forward is to seek settlement through bilateral talks, several foreign experts told Xinhua in recent interviews.  Full story</text:p><text:p>Interview: Manila intensifies tension in South China Sea -- former diplomat</text:p><text:p>MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has been behind the intensifying tensions in the South China Sea, a former diplomat of the country told Xinhua on Wednesday.</text:p><text:p>Alberto Encomienda, former secretary-general of Maritime and Ocean Affairs Center of the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department, said: &quot;China has been for the negotiations all along, but from the beginning we are not.&quot; Full story</text:p><text:p>How to Bridge the Divide Over the South China Sea</text:p><text:p>The differences between China and the U.S. over the South China Sea issue have become a matter of concern and even anxiety.

Those are the areas we need to prioritize,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Dominguez added, &quot;We have 42 million people who are in the workforce. And the statistics show that about 5.7 percent of them are unemployed and around 18 percent of them are underemployed ... that&apos;s about 10 million who are unemployed and most of them as we know live in the rural areas. So, it&apos;s very important that jobs are created in those rural areas.&quot;</text:p><text:p>&quot;We are listening to the people,&quot; Dominguez said, noting that Duterte won by a landslide because Filipinos are yearning for a better life which they did not feel during the administration of outgoing President Benigno Aquino.</text:p><text:p>Duterte, who will take his oath of office on June 30, has vowed to stamp out corruption, criminality and reduce poverty in the country during his six-year term of office.</text:p><text:p>To lure foreign investors to the Philippines, Duterte has said that he is open to lifting the restrictions on foreign ownership of Philippine corporations in the Philippine constitution and that more transportation infrastructure projects will be undertaken &quot;in every region&quot; during his administration.</text:p><text:p>Specifically, he is looking at a Mindanao railway system in the southern Philippines.</text:p><text:p>Duterte&apos;s economic team has bared the economic policies that the Duterte administration plans to pursue.</text:p><text:p>The incoming administration will &quot;continue and maintain the current macroeconomic policies;&quot; however, the team said that &quot;reforms in tax revenue collection (in the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Bureau of Customs) efforts will be complemented by reforms within the bureaucracy of these tax collecting agencies.&quot;</text:p><text:p>The team said the new administration will accelerate infrastructure spending by addressing, among others, major bottlenecks in the public-private partnership program while maintaining the target of setting aside 5 percent of the country&apos;s gross domestic product for infrastructure spending.</text:p><text:p>&quot;(The Duterte administration) will ensure attractiveness of the Philippines to foreign direct investments by addressing restrictive economic provisions in the Constitution and our laws, and enhancing competitiveness of the economy,&quot; the team said.</text:p><text:p>The administration also vowed to &quot;pursue genuine agricultural development strategy by providing support services to the small farmers to increase their productivity, improve their market access, and develop the agricultural value chain by forging partnership with agribusiness firms.&quot;</text:p><text:p>The economic agenda also includes unclogging the bottlenecks in the land administration and management system, strengthening the country&apos;s basic education system, improving the income tax system &quot;to make it progressive to enable those who earn little to have more money in their pockets,&quot; and expand and improve implementation of the conditional cash transfer program.</text:p><text:p>The Duterte administration said it plans to promote science, technology and the creative art &quot;to enhance innovation and creative capacity.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Moreover, it said Duterte will strengthen the implementation of the responsible parenthood and reproductive health law &quot;to enable all, especially poor couples, to make informed choices on financial and family planning.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Dominguez said the economic agenda of the Duterte administration &quot;is simply following what the electorate has spoken to us about,&quot; adding that Duterte got elected because &quot;he stood for peace and order, no crime, no drugs, no corruption and inclusive growth.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Incoming Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia told a news conference that he predicts the economy to expand by at least 6.5 percent this year.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Since it&apos;s the start of the new administration, we will have adjustment pains.

(Xinhua file photo)</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States likes to think of itself as a force for peace, law and justice, and the deployment of two aircraft carriers on a &quot;training mission&quot; in East Asia obviously backs up that aspiration. Or does it?</text:p><text:p>The timing of the operation -- just ahead of a ruling on South China Sea disputes -- is surely a deliberated one. The United States has dressed up the illegal, unilateral arbitration instigated by the Philippines as a noble act of homage to international law, while China&apos;s complete ambivalence toward irrelevant proceedings in The Hague is painted as disrespectful and a violation of that same international law.</text:p><text:p>Why the big show of strength now?</text:p><text:p>After countless promises not to take sides in South China Sea disputes, the arrival of the warships is presumably just another aspect of the &quot;peaceful resolution based on international law&quot; which the Obama administration has so consistently advocated.</text:p><text:p>Since the Philippines took it upon itself to open the arbitration, China has been drawn as the neighborhood bully who wants to militarize the region, but facts speak louder than hollow words and now more than 60 countries openly support China&apos;s stance. Could that be what all these warships, fighter jets and troops are about?</text:p><text:p>To the United States, these moves might look like &quot;peace, law and justice,&quot; but to everyone else they appear to be exactly what they are: militarization.</text:p><text:p>Even the Philippines smells a rat.

Is U.S. support for the arbitration really for the sake of the Philippines? Or is it all about China?</text:p><text:p>If there are any lessons to be learned from the past, the Philippines would know that bringing outsiders into any dispute invariably complicates matters, and never calms things down.</text:p><text:p>To paraphrase &quot;Game of Thrones,&quot; the Philippines may well ask themselves whether it is worthy &quot;to fight for the master who would never fight and die for you?&quot;</text:p><text:p>As a new president preparing to assume office, Duterte would do well to give a thought to returning to the negotiating table.

     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Rodrigo Duterte will take his oath of office on Thursday as the Philippines&apos; 16th president.</text:p><text:p>On the campaign trail, the tough-talking former mayor from southern Philippines&apos; Davao City has promised to &quot;kill&quot; drug lords and shame corrupt government officials and policemen suspected of colluding with criminals.</text:p><text:p>&quot;We&apos;ll just make this country peaceful and we&apos;ll have the investments coming in,&quot; the 71-year-old said in a speech in Davao City Monday, warning he will not allow a Mexico-like narco-politics to reign in the country.</text:p><text:p>Fresh from last month&apos;s electoral victory, Duterte said he is ready to make sweeping policy changes during his six-year term. &quot;Change is coming,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Duterte&apos;s real work of delivering promises begins on Thursday.</text:p><text:p>Aside from cracking down on rampant crime and eradicating corruption, Duterte will also have to grapple with a slew of problems including rapid population growth, poor infrastructure, inefficient bureaucracy and widespread poverty.</text:p><text:p>COMBATING POVERTY</text:p><text:p>A quarter of the country&apos;s 100 million people are poor, according to the Asian Development Outlook 2015, the annual economic publication of the Asian Development Bank released in March.</text:p><text:p>In the first half of 2014, poverty incidence was reported at 25.8 percent, compared with 24.6 percent in the same period in 2013, rising due to higher food prices and damage to livelihoods caused by typhoons, the report said.</text:p><text:p>Many of the people of Mindanao, where Duterte hails, continue to grapple with abject poverty.</text:p><text:p>While the Philippines has posted solid growth in recent years, the report said unemployment and underemployment &quot;remain high.&quot;</text:p><text:p>&quot;Even when the unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January 2015, the lowest in 10 years, 2.6 million people remained jobless, nearly half of them aged 15-24 years, and a further 6.5 million were underemployed,&quot; the report said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Challenges are to accelerate infrastructure development and further improve the investment climate to regenerate more and better jobs for poverty reduction,&quot; the report said, adding that &quot;higher rates of investment are needed to build on recent gains and raise employment to reduce poverty.&quot;</text:p><text:p>The report said investment has improved in the Philippines but still lags behind its Southeast Asian neighbors Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The country&apos;s net foreign direct investment inflows &quot;are modest,&quot; despite a 66 percent increase to 6.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2014, it said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;A key constraint on growth stems from inadequate past investment in infrastructure,&quot; the report said. The Philippines ranked 95th out of 144 countries for the quality of its infrastructure in the Global Competitiveness Report 2014-2015 of the World Economic Forum.</text:p><text:p>Duterte&apos;s Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said infrastructure investment is priority, stressing the need to build railways, ports, airports, bridges and even cable cars to ease the monstrous traffic in Metro Manila. &quot;There will be connectivity of islands,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Investors have indeed shun the Philippines, discouraged by poor roads, unreliable power supply and bad communication facilities, analysts said, adding that rampant corruption, unsolved violent crimes and decades-old insurgencies also mar the country&apos;s investment climate.</text:p><text:p>The ADB has predicted that the Philippines will see strong growth to continue this year and next, 6 percent in 2016 and 6.1 percent in 2017 respectively.</text:p><text:p>Richard Bolt, ADB country director for the Philippines, has earlier said that to sustain this growth &quot;will require the continuation of policies that support infrastructure and human capital development, improvements to the investment climate, and better governance.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Duterte has vowed to promote contraceptives to prevent population explosion. &quot;I will reinstall the program of family planning. One. Two. Three. That&apos;s enough.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Duterte has said he intends to amend some provisions in the 1987 constitution in a bid to transform the country into a federal state and lift the economic provisions that hamper foreign investors from investing in the country. &quot;Nothing short of a federal structure would give Mindanao peace,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>BOOSTING RECONCILIATION</text:p><text:p>Days before taking his oath this Thursday, Duterte sent his aides to Oslo, Norway to initiate peace talks with exiled leaders of the Left that has been fighting the government for decades. He has also met with Muslim rebels. &quot;I will call for inclusive talks with everybody, the Moros (Mindanao Muslims), the (Communist) rebels,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Duterte has also decided to allow the burial of former President Ferdinand Marcos in the Heroes&apos; Cemetery, saying this will bring healing to the country. &quot;I will allow the burial of President Marcos in the Heroes Cemetery not because he is a hero but because he was a Filipino soldier.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Marcos died in Hawaii in 1989, his body, which was brought to the Philippines in 1993, is now on display inside a glass box in an air-conditioned crypt in the Marcos family&apos;s ancestral home north of Manila.</text:p><text:p>The past administrations have refused Marcos&apos;s body to be interred at the national heroes&apos; cemetery, causing years of on-and-off political debates on whether the disgraced leader deserved a military honor and a plot in the hallowed ground.</text:p><text:p>Another bold move that Duterte wants to make is to free former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who is now detained at a hospital over plunder charges. Duterte, a lawyer, said Arroyo has been detained for four years without trial.</text:p><text:p>&quot;She deserves to be released. She has been detained for so long, the trial delayed,&quot; Duterte said, adding Arroyo is a victim of slow justice.</text:p><text:p>CRACKING DOWN ON CRIMINALS</text:p><text:p>He stressed the need to reimpose the death penalty so he could hang criminals. &quot;When you kill someone, rape, you should die. I believe in retribution. Why? You should pay,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Duterte&apos;s platform promises have won him more than 16.6 million votes, a resounding victory. Filipinos are pinning their hopes on Duterte, hoping for better and safer lives.</text:p><text:p>Duterte was first elected as mayor of Davao in 1988 and since then never lost an election until he became president.</text:p><text:p>&quot;In Davao we were able to correct the so many errors along the way. I intend to do the same for the whole country. I will be harsh to the criminals. I will be strict to the wrongdoers but you&apos;d always find something in me... especially those who are hopeless, helpless and defenseless,&quot; he said in his farewell speech Monday in Davao City where he was mayor for 22 years.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I like the fact that he puts law and order first,&quot; said political analyst Clarita Carlos. &quot;No other activity can happen if there is rampant criminality. I want those drug lords to be put to jail. Business (sector) wants law and order for economic activity to prosper.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Political science Professor Edmund Tayao said Duterte&apos;s plans are doable: &quot;All he is saying is that he doesn&apos;t mind using every means available in order to accomplish his promise of a crime-free society in as little as six month. That can be done.&quot;</text:p><text:p/>

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>By Wang Wen, Dario Agnote</text:p><text:p>MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine new president Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday vowed to tackle the country&apos;s problems and rebuild public confidence in the government in his inauguration speech. Experts here believe he faces enormous challenges to achieve his goals.</text:p><text:p>Duterte won the Philippine presidential election held on May 9 with 16,601,997 votes, a lead of almost 7 million over the second-placer Manuel Roxas.</text:p><text:p>For many, especially the grassroots, Duterte himself embodies hope of change.</text:p><text:p>In his inauguration speech, the former Davao City mayor vowed to crack down on illegal drugs, high criminality and corruption, seek peaceful agreements with leftist and Moro rebels, and lift the poor out of poverty.</text:p><text:p>The 71-year-old politician believed that the &quot;erosion of faith and trust in government&quot; is the most serious problem facing his administration.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I see the erosion of the people&apos;s trust in our country&apos;s leaders; the erosion of faith in our judicial system; the erosion of confidence in the capacity of our public servants to make the people&apos;s lives better, safer and healthier,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>As for government&apos;s peaceful agreement with leftist and Moro rebels, Duterte said in his speech that his administration is &quot;committed to implement all signed peace agreements in step with constitutional and legal reforms.&quot;</text:p><text:p>The Duterte administration and the country&apos;s leftist movement had already held preliminary talks in the middle of June to set the tone for the resumption of the stalled formal peace process.</text:p><text:p>Negotiators for the Philippine government and leftist National Democratic Front said the two sides agreed on the agenda of their formal talks in the third week of July in Oslo.</text:p><text:p>The agenda includes the release of political prisoners, the mode of interim ceasefire and the way to speed up the negotiation process.</text:p><text:p>Even before he won the May 9 elections, Duterte promised to resume the peace process with the leftist rebels.</text:p><text:p>The government has been trying to forge peace with the leftist rebels since 1986, but the on-off talks have faltered many times in the past.</text:p><text:p>In mid-June, Duterte met with leaders of the Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in what was described as a &quot;meeting of a brother to a brother.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Experts believed that Duterte must make sure to install the most capable and competent people in the government, otherwise it will be the same-old story.</text:p><text:p>Emil Jurado, columnist for the daily newspaper The Standard, wrote on Thursday that he doubted the promises to end criminality, illegal drugs and corruption within six months would be realized.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The most seasoned law enforcers, like former Philippine National Police chief Panfilo Lacson, say this is simply not doable. Unless, of course, Duterte declares martial law or establishes a revolutionary government,&quot; he wrote.</text:p><text:p>Earl Parreno, a political analyst with the Institute of Political and Electoral Reforms, said one of Duterte&apos;s biggest challenges is how to manage the people&apos;s expectations.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I have high hopes in his presidency, but I also recognize that there are very high risks,&quot; he said, adding that his hope &quot;is anchored on his sincerity and his bias in favor of the poor.&quot;</text:p><text:p>&quot;He raised the bar of expectations really high: can he really implement his anti-crime and anti-corruption policies programs in so short a time? ... Will the masses feel these changes? How is he going to deliver these changes that he promised to the masses. These are the challenges that he needs to address,&quot; Parreno said. </text:p><text:p/>

He finished his secondary education at the Holy Cross Academy of Digos in Digos City, Davao del Sur after being expelled twice from previous schools.</text:p><text:p>He received BA degree in political science in 1968 at Lyceum of the Philippines University in Manila. In 1972, he obtained a law degree from San Beda College of Law and passed the bar exam in the same year.</text:p><text:p>From 1977 to 1979, Duterte became Special Counsel at the City Prosecution Office in Davao City.</text:p><text:p>From 1979 to 1986, he climbed all the way from Fourth Assistant City Prosecutor to Second Assistant City Prosecutor.</text:p><text:p>He was elected vice mayor of Davao city in 1986 and then mayor in 1988. He was re-elected twice in 1992 and 1995.</text:p><text:p>In 1998, because he was term-limited to run again for mayor, he ran for the House of Representatives and won as Congressman of the 1st District of Davao City. In 2001, he ran again for mayor in Davao and was again elected for his fourth term. He was re-elected in 2004 and in 2007.</text:p><text:p>In 2007 he was elected vice mayor and his daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio, was elected as mayor. He has been Davao city mayor since 2010.</text:p><text:p>Under Duterte&apos;s governing, crime rates dropped drastically and he was nicknamed &quot;the Punisher&quot; for his crime-busting crusade there.</text:p><text:p>A 2015 Crime Situation Report released by the national police said that from 2010 to 2015, based on total incidents, Davao was top among 15 cities for murder, number two for rape and third for robbery.</text:p><text:p>With Duterte&apos;s efforts, the Davao city council imposed a prohibition on selling, serving, drinking and consuming alcoholic beverages from 01:00 until 08:00 each morning. He signed executive order which reduced the speed limits for all kinds of motor vehicles within the territorial jurisdiction of Davao City in the interest of public safety and order. He also made sure a comprehensive anti-smoking ordinance was carried out smoothly.</text:p><text:p>On Oct. 16, 2015, on the last day of filing for certificates of candidacy, Duterte did not show up. Martin Dino filed his intent to run for president under Duterte&apos;s party, PDP-Laban.</text:p><text:p>On Oct. 27, PDP-Laban made it official that Duterte will substitute as the party&apos;s presidential bet if aspirant Dino withdraws or is disqualified by the Commission of Elections (Comelec). Two days later, Dino officially withdrew his presidential bid and named Duterte as his substitute because of the possibility that Dino might be declared a nuisance candidate by Comelec.</text:p><text:p>During the presidential campaign period, the general public&apos;s crave for change has been very apparent, as they have grown to be disappointed at the country struck by poverty, corruption and public security crises.</text:p><text:p>Most of the voters interviewed by Xinhua said they want the new president to lead a fast developing country that is corruption free and an improved social security net.</text:p><text:p>Duterte embodied the hope of change to many Filipinos.</text:p><text:p>He has been leading most of the opinion polls since April. Some 33 percent of the voters said they would vote for Duterte in the final pre-election survey conducted by Social Weather Station.</text:p><text:p>The country&apos;s renowned polling body carried out the survey from May 1 to May 3 through face-to-face interviews with 4,500 validated voters nationwide with a sampling error margin of 1 point.</text:p><text:p>In some campaign activities, he vowed to wipe out corruption, drugs and criminality in three to six months if he wins the election.</text:p><text:p>His aggressive behavior and offensive language won him a lot of supporters, but aroused concerns and controversy as well.</text:p><text:p>The outgoing president Aquino has warned repeatedly the risk for the country to fall under a dictatorship if citizens voted Duterte.</text:p><text:p>Duterte is the first president to be nationally elected without a previous national position.</text:p><text:p>After Emilio Aguinaldo, Duterte is the second non-resident of Metro Manila to become president.</text:p><text:p>He was married to Elizabeth A. Zimmerman from 1973 to 2001. His current partner is Cielito Avancena.</text:p><text:p/>

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>by Xinhua Writer Sun Ding</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- As Rodrigo Duterte takes over as Philippine president on Thursday, sparks of hope have arisen for a rapprochement between his country and China after relations soured during his predecessor&apos;s tenure.</text:p><text:p>Yet whether those sparks can turn into flames heating up bilateral relations depends on whether Duterte can translate his positive signals into concrete and effective action.</text:p><text:p>The tough-talking former mayor of Davao City in southern Philippines has pledged sweeping policy changes on both domestic and diplomatic fronts.</text:p><text:p>Since winning election, he has made a string of overtures on Philippines-China relations, signaling that mending fences with China would be a foreign policy priority. He has said that China will be the first country he visits after taking office.</text:p><text:p>Such gestures are encouraging, particularly against the backdrop of the strained bilateral relations during the presidency of Benigno Aquino III, whose government repeatedly stoked tensions over the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>In violation of Manila&apos;s agreement with Beijing to solve their South China Sea disputes via bilateral negotiations, the Aquino government unilaterally launched a compulsory arbitration case against China, not only undercutting its own trustworthiness but further complicating the row and the bilateral relationship.</text:p><text:p>Yet as many observers have noted, Duterte is also seeking U.S. support on the South China Sea issue among others and help in building the island country&apos;s regional clout.</text:p><text:p>So the new president still keeps his cards close to his chest. Whether he means what he has said about pursuing bilateral talks with China over the South China Sea disputes remains to be seen.</text:p><text:p>However, although the arbitration case has stolen much of the limelight on China-Philippines relations, the political farce staged by the Aquino government is far from being the whole picture of bilateral ties.</text:p><text:p>In 2015, China stood as the Philippines&apos; largest source of imports second-largest trading partner, and third-largest export market. Bilateral trade reached 45.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 2.7 percent. Those figures offer just a glimpse of the close interaction between the two neighbors.</text:p><text:p>The incoming Philippine government has also voiced hopes for cooperating with China to develop the Southeast Asian country&apos;s infrastructure. Duterte has even reportedly said that he might seek joint exploration in the South China Sea, a principle China has long been advocating.</text:p><text:p>With China having rightly kept the door of dialogue open, the ball is in Manila&apos;s court. If Duterte&apos;s words about putting China-Philippines ties back on the right track are genuine, it is time for him to act.</text:p><text:p>Related:</text:p><text:p>Spotlight: Philippines&apos; new president Duterte expected to be pragmatic in China approach</text:p><text:p>MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- New Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to take a pragmatic approach to the South China Sea disputes with China, analysts here have said, noting that Manila will benefit a lot from a friendly relationship with Beijing.</text:p><text:p>Duterte was sworn in as the country&apos;s 16th president on Thursday.

But we have to ask ourselves: what did we get from this long conflict? What&apos;s wrong if we talk to them?&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Lim noted that the new administration must exercise flexibility and have an open, clear mind if it wants to deal with China.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It&apos;s about time we think seriously what exactly we want in that region instead of carrying a quarrel that is leading to something that is not constructive,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Asked whether he will see a change in the relationship between Manila and Beijing, Lim said it depends on what the Duterte administration will do.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The Department of Foreign Affairs and the people there should ask themselves the questions: What exactly do we want to do with the South China Sea issue? What are we going to ask for? We cannot say that it is ours ... Standoff again. There&apos;s nothing we can gain from that position. Nothing progressive will take place,&quot; Lim said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;So our leadership need to assess and think very carefully what we need and what is most beneficial for the country if we sit down and talk,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Duterte said last month that he wanted China to help improve the country&apos;s poor infrastructure by building a railway system that links the entire country.</text:p><text:p>Clarita Carlos, a professor with the University of the Philippines and president of the Centre for Asia Pacific Studies Inc, said Duterte is doing a &quot;brilliant&quot; strategy in dealing with China.</text:p><text:p>&quot;What is important is we keep on talking and engaging constructively with China,&quot; Carlos said, predicting that the relations between the two countries will improve.</text:p><text:p>Related:</text:p><text:p>Interview: Philippines&apos; call for South China Sea arbitration &quot;catastrophic mistake&quot; -- Serbian MP</text:p><text:p>by Nemanja Cabric and Wang Huijuan</text:p><text:p>BELGRADE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Manila&apos;s unilateral initiation of arbitration on the South China Sea disputes with China is a &quot;catastrophic mistake,&quot; Vladimir Djukanovic, member of the Serbian National Assembly said here on Wednesday.</text:p><text:p>Djukanovic, also a member of the presidency of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party, told Xinhua in an interview that the move aims to prolong the process of finding a solution to this dispute and help the United States maintain its influence on trade in the South China Sea.

      <text:p><text:s/>Spotlight: Expectation of resumption of sound development of China-Philippines relations</text:p>
     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- As the farce of arbitration on the South China Sea is to end soon, it is time for the new Philippine government of Rodrigo Duterte to stop the wrong foreign policy of its predecessor, so as to bring China-Philippines ties back to the track of sound development.</text:p><text:p>Since Duterte assumed presidency on Thursday, sparks of hope have arisen for resumption of sound development of relations between China and the Philippines after bilateral ties seriously deteriorated during the rule of former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III.</text:p><text:p>In 2013, the government of Aquino III filed a case of arbitration with the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration over territorial disputes between China and the Philippines on the South China Sea, stoking tensions in the South China Sea region.</text:p><text:p>On June 29 -- just a day before the assumption of presidency by Duterte, the Permanent Court of Arbitration announced that an arbitral award in the case initiated by the Philippines against China will be issued on July 12, meaning that the farce of arbitration started by the government of Aquino III will come to an end in days.</text:p><text:p>Since winning the election, Duterte has made a series of overtures on China-Philippines relations, signaling that improvement of relations with China would be a foreign policy priority of his government, in sharp contrast to the wrong foreign policy pursued by the former government.</text:p><text:p>As whoever started the trouble should be responsible for settling it, any substantial improvement of relations between China and the Philippines under the current situation actually depends on efforts of the Philippine side. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether the new Philippine government will be able to play the role of settling the trouble left over by the former government, how long it will take before the new Philippine government can shake off the burden of wrong diplomacy created by its predecessor, how much efforts it will make in this endeavor, and how it will face the serious harm caused by the farce of arbitration to China-Philippines relations.</text:p><text:p>Today, there do exist chances for the new Philippine government to substantially improve relations with China, and also for it to eliminate negative impacts of the farce of arbitration on China-Philippine relations and even on the regional situation.</text:p><text:p>In a message to congratulate Duterte on his victory in the election more than one month ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that China and the Philippines see a long history of friendly exchanges and profound traditional friendship between the two peoples.</text:p><text:p>&quot;A friendly, stable and sound China-Philippines relationship is in the fundamental interest of the two countries and the two peoples,&quot; Xi said, adding that he hoped the two sides would work together to get bilateral relations back onto the track of sound development.</text:p><text:p>In response, Duterte said he was &quot;honored&quot; to receive the congratulatory message from the Chinese president, calling him a great leader.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I was honored receiving a congratulatory message from a great president,&quot; Duterte reportedly made the remarks when speaking with reporters in Davao City after unveiling the members of his cabinet to the media.</text:p><text:p>The indirect &quot;dialogue&quot; reflected by the two foregoing passages has been interpreted as a positive signal for improvement of relations between China and the Philippines. It is noteworthy that both sides mentioned therein the history of China-Philippines relations, and that both emphasized the existence of a long history of friendly exchange between China and the Philippines and the maintenance of profound traditional friendship between the Chinese and Philippine peoples.</text:p><text:p>Since ancient times, China and the Philippines have maintained friendly exchange and profound traditional friendship between the two peoples, which is just one of the reasons why the two countries can get bilateral ties back onto the track of sound development despite negative impacts of the wrong foreign policy pursued by the government of Aquino III.</text:p><text:p>In history, the South China Sea used to be an important link via which the two countries conducted friendly and equal exchanges.</text:p><text:p>Historical literature &quot;The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898&quot; gave an account of a story about friendly contacts between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>In 1626 AD, the region of today&apos;s Hermosa in the Philippine province of Bataan was facing a severe famine, but the then Manila government was unable to offer aid to the region. Local Catholics had to pray every day that Chinese merchant ships could come as annually scheduled to help them cope with the emergency. Shortly afterwards, when six Chinese ships fully loaded with rice arrived on Hermosa port from the South China Sea, the locals hailed the timely rescue as &quot;a gift from God.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Almost at the same time, chronicles of southeast China&apos;s Fujian Province known as &quot;The Book of Fujian&quot; also recorded a history of people-to-people contacts between the two countries, saying that sweet potato widely planted in today&apos;s China had actually been introduced from Luzon -- today&apos;s Philippines.</text:p><text:p>At that time, after seeing that sweet potato was widely grown in Luzon and its growth had gained good harvests, businessmen took sweet potato plants via the South China Sea to Fujian, where they were successfully planted. During the first years of extensive cultivation of sweet potato, it helped local people survive famines.</text:p><text:p>In the long history, the South China Sea mainly played the role as such a link and platform for equal exchanges and common development between China and neighboring countries.</text:p><text:p>However, in the past few years, the government of Aquino III put aside the traditional friendship between the two countries and the needs of the Philippine people&apos;s livelihood and development by pursuing a wrong foreign policy that led to serious deterioration of relations between China and the Philippines. Considering oral promises made by some countries outside the region as a security umbrella and economic driving force, Aquino III internationalized the South China Sea issue and was willing to serve as a vanguard for those countries in muddying the waters in the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>In fact, it is difficult for Manila to find its real security interests from the frequent navigation by foreign military vessels on the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>In economy, the promises of some Western countries have not helped improve the people&apos;s livelihood in the Philippines. Instead, escalation of South China Sea disputes has deprived many Filipinos of their means of survival.</text:p><text:p>Therefore, the cognitive, decision-making and strategic errors the Aquino government committed will finally bring bitter fruit to its people and even undermine regional stability and prosperity.</text:p><text:p>Only enhancing win-win cooperation and developing the economy are in the fundamental interests of the two countries.</text:p><text:p>As is known to all, China has been prudent and tolerant in handling its relations with the Philippines while considering the Philippine people&apos;s livelihood.</text:p><text:p>In 2015, bilateral relations were difficult, and the trade between China and other Asian countries as well as between China and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations went down by 7.8 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. However, the China-Philippines trade hit a record high of 45.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 2.7 percent from a year ago.</text:p><text:p>Now, China has become the Philippines&apos; largest source of imports, second largest trade partner and third largest export market. The two countries are complementary to each other in industry, with the existence of great potential for economic growth and broad prospects for investment cooperation, which makes up a right way for mutually beneficial cooperation compared to the empty promises some countries made to Aquino III.</text:p><text:p>In the 1980s, then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, after meeting then Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel and then Philippine President Corazon Aquino successively, proposed peacefully solving the South China Sea disputes, and shelving disputes while seeking joint development. The reason why such a constructive consensus was reached was that the two sides realized that hope was far more than difficulties and common interests were far more than differences.</text:p><text:p>Only through cooperation and common development can China-Philippines relations be brought back onto the track of sound development. As long as the Philippines remembers the history, envisages realities and refrains from jumping into traps set by some forces outside the region, it will not be difficult for it to substantially improve relations with China. </text:p><text:p>Related:</text:p><text:p>China calls on Philippines to properly solve maritime disputes via negotiation</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday called on the Philippines to work with China to use the power of negotiation to solve disputes on the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei made the remarks at a daily press briefing in response to remarks made by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte during the first meeting of his cabinet after his inauguration Thursday.Full Story</text:p><text:p/>

     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The widely circulated Philippine Daily Inquirer on Monday ran an editorial saying the Philippines can avail itself of the infrastructure lending program being offered by Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to finance the country&apos;s massive infrastructure needs.</text:p><text:p>The editorial, headlined &quot;China Funding Initiative,&quot; says the Philippines and other developing countries in the region will need the AIIB and benefit from it.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The AIIB has been described as modern and multilateral, or China&apos;s &apos;21st-century&apos; answer to lenders like the World Bank, which has always been led by Americans, and the Asian Development Bank, which is dominated by Japan,&quot; says the editorial.</text:p><text:p>&quot;And the Philippines will be better off borrowing through a more transparent AIIB lending window now,&quot; it says.</text:p><text:p>The ADB estimates that the region requires 750 billion U.S. dollars in investment annually until 2020 to fund its infrastructure needs, which the bank says it cannot finance on its own.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The Philippines&apos; infrastructure financing needs from 2010 through 2020 was placed at 127.12 billion U.S. dollars. This will require an annual investment of 11.56 billion U.S. dollars, which the government failed to fill in the past six year,&quot; the editorial says.</text:p><text:p>The Philippines has maritime and territorial disputes with China on the South China Sea. Diplomatic relations between Manila and Beijing soured when Manila brought the case to a U.N. arbitral tribunal in 2013.</text:p><text:p>But despite the Philippines&apos; territorial dispute, the editorial says &quot;it&apos;s possible for the Philippines to have strong trade and investment relations with the global economic powerhouse.&quot;</text:p><text:p>&quot;One major avenue for this is the AIIB, which the Philippines joined at the last minute in December 2015,&quot; the editorial says.</text:p><text:p>Since its launch last January, it says the AIIB has approved four loans worth 509 million U.S. dollars for projects in Pakistan, Tajikistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh. &quot;Multilateral lenders such as World Bank usually take more than a year to approve similar project loans,&quot; it says.</text:p><text:p>The bank could support projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to link Asia, Europe and Africa through the construction of massive infrastructure such as railways and ports.</text:p><text:p>The editorial says the Belt and Road Initiative is believed by some experts to even help ease tension around the South China Sea as it expands economic cooperation among neighbors in the region.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Billions of dollars in investments are expected to pour into the construction of railway facilities, airports and sea ports and power plants that, in turn, would trigger the growth of job-generating factories. Beside, while it is true that the AIIB is linked to China&apos;s own economic and strategic goals, what is wrong in having better China-funded infrastructure in the country?&quot; the article says.</text:p><text:p>The Philippines signed the Articles of Agreement of the AIIB in December last year, officially joining the newly-created multilateral institution aimed at boosting infrastructure development and connectivity.</text:p><text:p>In a statement before the signing, then Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said Manila believes that AIIB &quot;will augment and complement existing multilateral institutions in accelerating economic growth.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Last month, new Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, through his spokesperson Paola Alvarez, told the Inquirer that the new administration of President Rodrigo Duterte will &quot;definitely pursue joining the AIIB&quot; to increase the country&apos;s spending.</text:p><text:p>&quot;With (heavy vehicular) traffic and the lack of basic infrastructure projects being hindrances to Philippine economic prosperity, the membership of the Philippines to AIIB is surely something that the people will benefit from,&quot; the Inquirer quoted Alvarez as saying. </text:p><text:p/>

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The South China Sea arbitration unilaterally initiated by former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III has not only soured China-Philippines ties, but also undermined international rule of law and regional stability.</text:p><text:p>The arbitration was a bad idea from the beginning for one simple reason: it is detrimental to the interests of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that groups 10 member states, including the Philippines.</text:p><text:p>Firstly, the integrity of ASEAN is at stake. The United States, a close ally of the Philippines, has long interfered in the region and is using the arbitration to widen divisions and undermine mutual trust. ASEAN members have differed on the South China Sea issue, the arbitration, as well as external intervention by non-regional countries.</text:p><text:p>Secondly, the arbitration compromises existing ASEAN rules of conduct. For more than half a century, ASEAN member states have emphasized a spirit of equality, consensus and cooperation.</text:p><text:p>For example, the dual-track approach, originally thought up by ASEAN and supported by China, advocates that disputes should be resolved peacefully through negotiations between parties directly concerned. It further calls on China and ASEAN to work together to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>The dual-track approach is the most pragmatic way to manage maritime and territorial disputes in the South China Sea. It is also in full compliance with the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), signed by China and all ASEAN members in 2002.</text:p><text:p>However, the unilateral arbitration against China completely disregards the DOC, denies the double-track approach and ignores ASEAN&apos;s many past achievements in using negotiation as a tool to resolving disputes.</text:p><text:p>Thirdly, regional security is at risk. The frequent visits by aircraft and warships from countries outside the region are a deep concern for ASEAN and could spark an arms race. Some external countries having a hidden agenda are repeatedly muddying the waters, leaving regional countries to bear the brunt of any consequent instability.</text:p><text:p>More importantly, arbitration isn&apos;t a panacea to solving disputes. Instead, it more likely creates more disputes and stokes regional tensions, doing harm to the fundamental interests of peoples in the region.</text:p><text:p>With regard to the so-called arbitration, China has repeated its stance of non-acceptance of third-party dispute settlements or any imposed solution.</text:p><text:p>The disputes between China and the Philippines can only be solved via bilateral negotiations on the basis of fully respecting historical facts and in line with international laws.</text:p><text:p>Since winning election, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made a string of overtures on Philippines-China relations, with his spokesperson Ernesto Abella having said that Duterte wanted a &quot;conversation&quot; with China on the South China Sea to work out a &quot;win-win relationship&quot; with the country.</text:p><text:p>If Duterte is serious about solving the South China Sea issue properly and about bringing the China-Philippines ties back on track, it is time for him to act as a responsible player and make the right choice to eliminate the advance effects caused by the arbitration farce as soon as possible. </text:p><text:p/>

     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>by Alessandra Cardone</text:p><text:p>ROME, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming arbitration on the South China Sea dispute by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague is likely to stir more tensions in the region, said an Italian expert.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I reckon the judgement of the court will not help the dialogue between the two parties involved, China and the Philippines, but rather worsen the crisis,&quot; Domenico Losurdo, a famous Italian historical philosopher and professor at the University of Urbino, told Xinhua in a recent interview.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Bilateral negotiations would be instead the most effective path to solve the dispute,&quot; he added.</text:p><text:p>The two countries had already reached an agreement on settling their South China Sea disputes through bilateral negotiations in the mid-1990s, and again in the early 2000.</text:p><text:p>Yet, the Philippines unilaterally decided to bring the issue before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2013, seeking arbitration over the case.</text:p><text:p>&quot;By unilaterally filing the case against Beijing at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Philippines clearly contradicted its commitment to the ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), which it had previously signed,&quot; the expert said.</text:p><text:p>The DOC expressed the desire to enhance favorable conditions for a peaceful and durable solution of differences and disputes through friendly negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned.</text:p><text:p>&quot;That Agreement also appealed for the parties to exercise self-restraint, and avoid taking actions that could complicate or escalate the disputes,&quot; Losurdo stressed.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The unilateral initiative by the Philippine has exactly resulted in such an escalation, the outcome of which is now difficult to forecast,&quot; added the expert.</text:p><text:p>Losurdo, a professor emeritus of Philosophy and former Dean of the Science of Education Faculty at the University of Urbino, said the Philippines&apos; step made more sense in a broader, geopolitical perspective.</text:p><text:p>It was necessary to consider the U.S. strategic &quot;pivot to Asia&quot; or rebalancing launched by U.S. President Barack Obama&apos;s administration, which marked a shift in American foreign policy from the Middle East and Mediterranean area to the Asian Pacific region.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It is within this context that the Philippines decided to drop negotiations (with China) in 2013, and resort to arbitration before the Permanent Court with the help of U.S. legal consultants,&quot; said Losurdo.</text:p><text:p>According to the expert, the whole issue would serve U.S. interests in terms of preserving its hegemony in the Asian Pacific region, confining China as a &quot;land power&quot; only, and making a U.S. naval blockade easier during a possible crisis.</text:p><text:p>China asserts the international tribunal has no authority over such a case, which is essentially about territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation, and made clear it will not accept the arbitration.</text:p><text:p>&quot;This is also a widely shared view among international jurists. And the Permanent Court of Arbitration itself seems to indirectly confirm this line, by assessing the claim as a matter of interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),&quot; Losurdo said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Yet, the dispute is indeed about the sovereignty of the South China Sea islands,&quot; the expert added.</text:p><text:p>Furthermore, China excluded maritime delimitation from compulsory arbitration in a declaration made in 2006, in accordance with Article 298 of UNCLOS concerning the optional exceptions to the applicability of the U.N. Convention.</text:p><text:p>As Chinese authorities recently called again on Manila to abandon the arbitration application and return to bilateral negotiations, Losurdo suggested a positive development might come with the newly elected president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The new president seems more open to dialogue. Somehow, bilateral negotiations might still resurface as the main pathway to solve this dispute,&quot; he told Xinhua. </text:p><text:p/>

Aquino III initiated the arbitration in 2013. Dialogues were disrupted after the tribunal claimed jurisdiction two years later.</text:p><text:p>Since talks stalled, tensions have mounted. U.S. warships and planes have frequented the South China Sea under the pretext of safeguarding &quot;freedom of navigation and overflight.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Meanwhile, Washington and Manila held a slew of joint military drills near the waters of the South China Sea. The scale of their war games kept increasing while the weapons used by their servicemen became increasingly sophisticated.</text:p><text:p>In April, thousands of U.S., Philippine and Australian troops attended an 11-day exercise in the South China Sea region, which deployed the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, capable of firing waves of rockets and missiles from a long range with great accuracy.</text:p><text:p>The high-profile U.S. military presence only cast a pall on the otherwise peaceful South China Sea, through which more than 100,000 ships pass annually without incidents.</text:p><text:p>&quot;LAWFARE&quot;</text:p><text:p>The U.S. intervention won&apos;t end with military muscle-flexing. Observers said that the arbitration is part of the &quot;lawfare&quot; that the United States has waged against China, by manipulating lawsuits and legal systems to tarnish China&apos;s claims and rights.</text:p><text:p>Although the arbitration was initiated by the Aquino III administration in 2013, U.S. support and abetment were crucial to its being carried forward. The 3,000-page documents that the Philippines handed over to the tribunal were compiled with the help of U.S. legal experts who also participated in the process of deliberations.</text:p><text:p>The U.S. support, analysts said, is also a key factor that encouraged the tribunal to accept and then claim jurisdiction over the flawed case.</text:p><text:p>In 2010, then U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that Washington has national interests in the South China Sea, amid the U.S.strategic shift to the Asia-Pacific region.</text:p><text:p>The United States and the Philippines issued a joint statement to back the arbitration in 2014. Later that year, U.S. President Barack Obama, during a visit to Manila, voiced his support for the arbitration.</text:p><text:p>QUESTIONABLE JURISDICTION</text:p><text:p>Outwardly, Manila&apos;s request was to determine the nature of features &quot;under Chinese control&quot; in the South China Sea. But its real agenda was to confuse the maritime rights assigned to different features, e.g. islands, low-tide elevations or submerged banks, with China&apos;s sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and its waters.</text:p><text:p>By dwelling on the nature of the features, the Philippines has attempted to limit China&apos;s maritime rights and interests to individual features, denying China&apos;s historic rights over the Nansha Islands as a whole.</text:p><text:p>Hence, the Philippines&apos; requests are essentially about territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation. Territorial issues are subject to general international law rather than the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), under which the tribunal operates.</text:p><text:p>In addition, China excluded disputes concerning maritime delimitation, historic bays or titles from UNCLOS dispute settlement procedures in 2006, according to the UNCLOS stipulation.</text:p><text:p>HISTORICAL FACTS</text:p><text:p>Before the colonization of Southeast Asia by Western powers, the South China Sea had been a peaceful and prosperous hub for trade and cultural exchanges for over a thousand years.</text:p><text:p>In AD 671, the Chinese monk Yi Jing set sail across the South China Sea to study Buddhism in India and came back 25 years later. During his journey, Yi visited 30 ancient countries in the South China Sea region, during which he shared Chinese culture and technology with his hosts.</text:p><text:p>Yi was among more than 60 Chinese monks who traveled through the South China Sea to India during that period. Their writings and travel logs are evidence that proves China&apos;s active role in promoting peace and prosperity in the waters.</text:p><text:p>In various Chinese dynasties, offices on sea affairs were set up, along with the launch of coast patrols to ensure safe passage in the waterway. For about a hundred years, China had worked with the state of Malacca to combat piracy in the South China Sea, until Malacca was colonized by Portugal in 1611.</text:p><text:p>MEDIA MISINFORMATION</text:p><text:p>China&apos;s rights over the South China Sea are backed by numerous historical records. However, some Western media have either turned a blind eye to the facts or twisted them to make up their own version of the &quot;truth.&quot;</text:p><text:p>In Tanmen, a fishing village in southern China, a retired fisherman told BBC that he once had an ancient book with navigation directions to the South China Sea. But he threw it away as it was no longer readable after being used for hundreds of years.</text:p><text:p>Upon hearing this, the BBC reporter started to question the existence of the book, suggesting the old fisherman, who had trusted him with his family story, was lying. He went on to accuse Chinese media, which had first reported on the book, of having made up the story to bolster China&apos;s claims.</text:p><text:p>Had the reporter bothered to visit the Hainan Provincial Museum, he would have seen those ancient navigation guides on public display.</text:p><text:p>In fact, generations of fishermen living in a number of harbors in Hainan have relied on such ancient guides to navigate in the South China Sea. At least 12 versions of them can be found in museums or fishing villages.</text:p><text:p>NEGOTIATION THE ONLY WAY</text:p><text:p>Any ultimate resolution of territorial issues must be based on the will of the states involved. History, national interests and people&apos;s feelings of each side need to be acknowledged and taken into consideration before any reconciliation and agreement can be achieved.</text:p><text:p>A rushed decision by a third party often leads to more disputes and conflicts. In Southeast Asia alone, problematic demarcations by colonists left Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Cambodia with long-standing land disputes among them and even separatist violence.</text:p><text:p>The South China Sea issue involves waters of 3.5 million square kilometers and several parties in the region. Its magnitude and complexity far exceed the capacity of any tribunal.</text:p><text:p>In addition, China has made it clear that the arbitration is illegal, null and void, and that the country does not accept it or participate in it.</text:p><text:p>Without China&apos;s acknowledgement and support, the &quot;award&quot; of the arbitration is practically infeasible, or &quot;just a piece of paper,&quot; as described by former Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo.</text:p><text:p>&quot;China will never give up our lawful rights. Chinese people do not believe in fallacy nor are we afraid of evil forces,&quot; Chinese President Xi Jinping said on July 1, commemorating the 95th founding anniversary of the Communist Party of China.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Chinese people do not make trouble, but we are not cowards when involved in trouble,&quot; Xi said.</text:p><text:p>The newly-elected Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has on multiple occasions shown willingness to resume talks with the Chinese side, a good starting point for reconciliation and mutual understanding between the two countries.</text:p><text:p>Hopefully, this &quot;piece of paper&quot; can serve as a lesson to remind all parties involved that there is no shortcut to resolving the South China Sea issue, and that the final solution to it can only be found at the negotiation table. </text:p><text:p/><text:p/>

     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>by Xinhua Writer Jiang Li</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The South China Sea arbitration came to an end with an arbitral tribunal in The Hague issuing an award on Tuesday, but the verdict is null and void and only serves to complicate the situation in the region.</text:p><text:p>With obvious loopholes and deliberate proceedings circumventing regular arbitration rules, the tribunal undermines international law and sets a bad example for settling sovereign disputes.</text:p><text:p>China has reiterated its stance of non-participation in and non-acceptance of the arbitration. To fully respect international law and justice, China will never recognize the verdict and never be &quot;forced&quot; into accepting it.</text:p><text:p>The former Philippine government and the United States behind it have conspired for a long time to blackmail China regarding its historic rights to the South China Sea, but to do it through a tribunal that tramples on international justice goes too far.</text:p><text:p>For starters, Manila broke its own commitment made in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002, which was signed between China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to settle disputes through consultation and negotiation.</text:p><text:p>Without consulting with China over the means of dispute settlement, the former Philippine government unilaterally filed a compulsory arbitration against China in 2013.</text:p><text:p>Despite Manila&apos;s claim to seek a verdict over the status and maritime entitlements of relevant features in the Nansha Islands, the subject matter regards sovereignty and delimitation issues clearly beyond the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.</text:p><text:p>To make matters worse, some countries outside the region have been making waves to serve their own interests.</text:p><text:p>The United States has been attempting to &quot;fish in troubled waters&quot; while instigating the Philippines to act on the so-called legal front. Sending warships and warplanes and holding military maneuvers, the United States has spared no efforts to stir up the waters of the South China Sea with its so-called &quot;Pivot to Asia&quot; strategy.</text:p><text:p>Meanwhile, Japan is an accomplice that attempted to hijack the Group of Seven meeting in April with the South China Sea issue as part of its efforts to serve its audacious ambitions.</text:p><text:p>The arbitration has only escalated tensions in the region and by no means helps to solve the disputes. The undermining of international law and the repercussions of a law-abusing arbitration are even more worrying than the dispute itself.</text:p><text:p>The new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has expressed the desire to engage in dialogue with China on the South China Sea issue, which is a welcomed sign.</text:p><text:p>Under the dual-track approach initially proposed by ASEAN, China and the Philippines could negotiate in line with international law and get bilateral ties back on track.</text:p><text:p>It&apos;s high time to put an end to this farce that has dragged on for too long. </text:p><text:p>Related:</text:p><text:p>Backgrounder: A brief look at the South China Sea arbitration case</text:p><text:p>Full text of statement of China&apos;s Foreign Ministry on award of South China Sea arbitration initiated by Philippines</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People&apos;s Republic of China on the Award of 12 July 2016 of the Arbitral Tribunal in the South China Sea Arbitration Established at the Request of the Republic of the Philippines issued on Tuesday.    Full story</text:p><text:p>Full text of Chinese gov&apos;t statement on China&apos;s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in S.

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>by Wang Wen, Yang Tianmu</text:p><text:p>MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine senior government officials Wednesday called on the Duterte administration to start bilateral talks with China immediately while ignoring the award issued by an ad hoc arbitral tribunal on the South China Sea issue Tuesday.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The negotiation must start immediately. And the arbitral ruling is both useless and irrelevant,&quot; said Valdes, former undersecretary of Philippine Department of Education.</text:p><text:p>Valdes questioned the validity of the award which claims Taiping Island as a rock despite the fact that the island has an airstrip, a hospital, several buildings and fresh water.</text:p><text:p>&quot;There is something wrong with the so called arbitration court,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>For Alberto Encomienda, former secretary-general of the Maritime and Ocean Affairs Center of the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department, the Philippines should not have taken the case to the tribunal in the first place.</text:p><text:p>He agrees with Valdes that the two governments should start to reconnect and talk bilaterally to solve the disputes as soon as possible.</text:p><text:p>In addition, the maritime expert believed &quot;if judged objectively, the ruling cannot be a leverage for the Philippines.&quot;</text:p><text:p>&quot;Let&apos;s begin from the beginning, rewind the clock, and go into consultations leading to negotiations and at the same time we work on joint development.&quot;</text:p><text:p>They have also voiced concern over the U.S. intervention into this regional issue.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The U.S. has been intervening too much in this region, even including on the matter of arbitration,&quot; said Encomienda.</text:p><text:p>When asked whether PCA&apos;s award will intensify conflict or even confrontation in the region, Encomienda said, &quot;if left to the two of us (China and the Philippines), the ruling should not intensify anything.&quot;</text:p><text:p>According to him, that&apos;s because right after the arbitral ruling came down, China issued a statement saying it adheres to the position of settling the issue through negotiation.

That policy stands still, like a rock.</text:p><text:p>As neighbors facing each other across the sea, China and the Philippines have been friends for generations. There were no territorial disputes between them until the 1970s, when the Philippines suddenly decided that some of China&apos;s islands and reefs were in fact theirs and occupied them without so much as a by-your-leave. China&apos;s reaction to this affront has been restrained, to say the least. It is not too great a leap of understanding to conclude that China is the encroached upon rather than the encroacher.</text:p><text:p>In 2013, the government of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III ignored previous agreements with China and went running to The Hague. Aquino has since become a figure of purely historical relevance, and the job of cleaning up his mess has fallen to the new Philippine President, Rodrigo Duterte, who seems ready and willing to talk directly with China.</text:p><text:p>Even after the absurd arbitration award, China retains its faith in a peaceful solution and would welcome direct talks over the negotiating table.</text:p><text:p>A statement issued by the Chinese leadership on Tuesday said that China is still ready to resolve disputes peacefully through negotiation and consultation with those states directly concerned. China will make every effort to seek win-win results and maintain the peace that is so vital to stability and prosperity in the region.</text:p><text:p>Bringing the issue back to the negotiation table, and thereafter to a long-term solution, is in the interests of all parties, and is now down to the Philippines. President Duterte has begun to make positive gestures, but is his country ready to walk his talk?</text:p><text:p>China has said that the door is always open, but will not welcome any unreasonable demands nor sit idly by if deliberately provoked.</text:p><text:p>China will now decide whether to declare an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the South China Sea in accordance with the extent of a threat. &quot;If our security were threatened, of course we have the right,&quot; Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin told the press.</text:p><text:p>Chinese people do not make trouble, but are not cowards when trouble is made for them. Whether the South China Sea becomes a troublesome tempest of confrontation or the peaceful waters of cooperation and common prosperity is up to the Philippines and its friends.</text:p><text:p>Is it not better to remain friends with a good neighbor than to allow some faraway superpower to stir up conflicts at the doorstep?

     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has no jurisdiction over territorial issues and maritime delimitation, a well-known South African commentator wrote in The Star newspaper on Thursday.</text:p><text:p>The West sees the South China Sea arbitration as an important crossroads in China&apos;s rise as a global power, but there are misperceptions, Shannon Ebrahim wrote in the commentary titled &quot;How West misperceives and misconceives Chinese politics.&quot;</text:p><text:p>&quot;It is not; it has already risen. China is actually 10 steps ahead of the West in most cases, and Shanghai makes New York look like the old world,&quot; she said.</text:p><text:p>One mistake the West has made is to view the arbitral tribunal on the South China Sea issue as a legitimate process in international law, but there was no legal basis for the tribunal to begin with, Ebrahim said.</text:p><text:p>The compulsory arbitration was unilaterally initiated in 2013 by the administration of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III, whose term ended on June 30. It issued an award on July 12 that sweepingly sides with Manila&apos;s claims.</text:p><text:p>The arbitration was not only outside the jurisdiction of UNCLOS, Ebrahim wrote in the popular South African newspaper, &quot;it also disregarded the preference of China for direct negotiations and consultations with the Philippines.&quot;</text:p><text:p>The new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has indicated a readiness to discuss with China about the South China Sea issue.</text:p><text:p>&quot;This leaves open the possibility of negotiations, which China has always called for, China will not, however, accept the tribunal&apos;s ruling as the basis for settling the dispute,&quot; Ebrahim said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The Western media is used to rallying around a cause without dissecting the credibility of that cause, and this is one such instance where the Western media has arguably been on the wrong side of history,&quot; she said.</text:p><text:p>The Washington Post has carried frequent headlines suggesting that China intends turning the South China Sea into an internal lake or a Chinese lake, without providing any proof to back up such claims.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The intended effect was to create the impression that China is the aggressor and not prepared to operate within the confines of international law,&quot; Ebrahim said.</text:p><text:p>She also noted that the reality of the situation is that the arbitral tribunal has no mechanism for enforcing its decision, and China will do exactly as it has stated all along -- simply ignore its findings.</text:p><text:p>In 1986, the United States ignored a ruling from the International Court of Justice that declared its mining in the harbors of Nicaragua illegal.</text:p><text:p>Washington is not a UNCLOS member. This leaves it with little credibility in terms of commenting on matters regarding adherence to UNCLOS.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It is an even greater double standard for the U.S. to have provided the rear guard support to the Philippines to unilaterally initiate the arbitration,&quot; Ebrahim said, adding that the arbitration is itself in violation of UNCLOS. </text:p><text:p/>

He said he does not want to go to war with China and that he is not interested in letting his country join America&apos;s &quot;free navigation&quot; action.</text:p><text:p>Duterte&apos;s gestures have given people a bit of confidence that the new Philippine government is trying to clean up the mess left over by his predecessor Benigno S. Aquino III, and bring relations with China back to the right track.</text:p><text:p>The invalid arbitration over the South China Sea, along with the subsequent political manipulation and Western media hoo-ha, has set a bad example of abusing international law and brought the issue to a dangerous and confrontational situation.</text:p><text:p>The current tension does no good to the China-Philippine relations, as well as the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. Bringing the disputes back to the right track of solution would serve the interests of both parties.</text:p><text:p>The Chinese leadership said Tuesday that China is ready to resolve disputes peacefully through negotiation and consultation with those states directly concerned. China will make every effort to seek win-win results and maintain the peace that is so vital to stability and prosperity in the region.</text:p><text:p>China and the Philippines are neighbors. The bilateral disputes are basically disagreements in the neighborhood, and can be solved through talks by the neighbors.</text:p><text:p>People expect the new Philippine government to show its sincerity with more concrete actions, and work with the Chinese side to properly manage and contain disagreements, so as to push bilateral relations back to its proper place.</text:p><text:p>Only by sealing a deal through equal negotiation among parties directly concerned can relevant disputes be fundamentally resolved, and the deal be effectively implemented.</text:p><text:p>Instead of being troubled waters, the South China Sea serves as a bridge connecting China and its neighbors. Maintaining the peace, stability and prosperity of the South China Sea is the common wish and responsibility of China and ASEAN members, and serves the interests of those countries.</text:p><text:p>As long as the parties insist on solving disagreements through negotiation and consultation and seeking win-win cooperation, the South China Sea will basically be a sea of peace and prosperity. </text:p><text:p/><text:p/>

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>by Xinhua Writer Liu Chang</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific boasts the world&apos;s most dynamic economies, highly lucrative markets and captivating cultural diversity. It could well become the future of the world. Yet some meddlers are jeopardizing that prospect.</text:p><text:p>Starting from Sunday, foreign ministers of the East Asia Summit countries will be under the same roof in the Laotian capital of Vientiane for a series of meetings. The coming days are a chance for the top diplomats to start engaging in damage control after the recent null and void award on the South China Sea arbitration, a blow to peace and stability in the region.</text:p><text:p>Worryingly, the arbitration, a unilateral move by the Philippines, has set a fraught and dangerous precedent of mishandling maritime disputes. Worse still, a handful of countries within and outside the region have urged China to follow the ruling by a highly questionable arbitral tribunal in The Hague, which has clearly acted beyond its jurisdiction. The ruling by no means helps solving the problem by peaceful ways and only serves to increase the likelihood of confrontation and turbulence.</text:p><text:p>In a latest positive sign, former Philippine President Fidel Ramos has accepted the offer of President Rodrigo Duterte to be special envoy to China, opening the possibility of dialogue between Beijing and Manila. It is a testimony that the South China Sea disputes can be solved by directly involved parties, without the interference from outsiders.</text:p><text:p>Still, the risks of rising tensions, fanned by a few countries may not be underestimated.</text:p><text:p>Despite Washington&apos;s denial, it clearly has a hand in this. During the past eight years, the Obama administration has mostly seen China as a potential challenger to its &quot;leadership&quot; in the region and has been seeking to curb its rise with its iconic &quot;Pivot to Asia&quot; policy.</text:p><text:p>By excluding China, the world&apos;s second-largest economy, from the Trans-Pacific Pact, Washington tries to be the only one who wears the pants in the region.</text:p><text:p>Meanwhile, the United States has left no stone unturned to sow discord between China and its neighbors. In the South China Sea, the United States paints China as a threat to freedom of navigation and accuses it of weaponizing the area. On the Korean Peninsula, it, under the pretext of deterring the missile menace from the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea, has managed to get the Blue House to okay its deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea. As the U.S. surveillance range penetrates deep into Chinese territories, tensions between Beijing and Seoul are flaring.</text:p><text:p>Japan is also good at muddying the waters. Tokyo tries to pressure Beijing on the South China Sea front, hoping that China will not be resourceful enough to handle the island contention in the East China Sea simultaneously. However, this tactic of distraction will not pay off given China&apos;s determination and capability to defend its territorial integrity.</text:p><text:p>The firebrands need to be careful of what they wish for. Their strategy of fanning China-phobia is only going to instigate distrust and disorder, and invite recession to the region, while their own security and economic interests will suffer heavy setbacks.</text:p><text:p>As for the East Asian nations, they have to stay vigilant about the U.S. foray into the region, and should refuse to be used as pawns in Washington&apos;s geopolitical board game. One would believe that the leaders of these nations would be wise enough to at least learn some lessons from the disgraceful Iraqi war and the following bloody interference in Libya and Syria that have turned almost the entire Middle East upside down and fostered the emergence of global terrorism&apos;s new standard-bearer, the Islamic State group.</text:p><text:p>Right now, the global economic recovery is still weak and unbalanced, while Asia&apos;s economies are also facing serious challenges. To get out of the economic wilderness, the East Asian nations need to forge even stronger partnerships, and turn away from ill-intentioned troublemakers.</text:p><text:p>China is the top trading partner of many East Asian nations, including most of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations members, while their past economic transactions have proved mutually rewarding.</text:p><text:p>As Beijing is getting ready to promote its Belt and Road Initiative, its neighbors would reap far more tangible benefits if they choose to broaden their cooperation with China, a market no country can afford to lose. </text:p><text:p>Related:</text:p><text:p>China, ASEAN seek to jointly build community of common destiny</text:p>

Rare commercial fish cultured here are sold well both home and abroad. (Xinhua/Zhao Yingquan) </text:p><text:p>BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The great expenses for the South China Sea arbitration unilaterally initiated by the former Philippine government should be made public, as some Filipinos are already questioning the source of the money.</text:p><text:p>In 2013, the Benigno Aquino III administration unilaterally filed a case on the South China Sea dispute between the Philippines and China. An ad hoc arbitral tribunal set up at Manila&apos;s request issued a highly controversial and biased award on July 12, denying China&apos;s long-standing historic rights in the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>Questions about how much money has been spent on the arbitration, paid by whom and to whom, have not only sparked hot debates in the Philippines, but also drawn attention worldwide.</text:p><text:p>It had cost Manila 30 million U.S. dollars to merely pay off legal fees and expenses of lawyers who prepared the case against China, Rigoberto Tiglao, former spokesperson and head of presidential office for former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, wrote in an article published in mid-July by the Manila Times.</text:p><text:p>This prompted a question, raised openly three days later by former senator Francisco S. Tatad, about the real cost of the arbitration. He suspected that the former Philippine government hid the truth from its nationals.</text:p><text:p>The government &quot;never told the public how much the arbitration would cost the Filipino taxpayers. The Constitution provides that no money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law, yet no appropriation has been disclosed for this particular purpose,&quot; he wrote to the Manila Times.</text:p><text:p>&quot;How much then is it? Are any foreign donors involved?&quot; he asked.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency or its State Department should reimburse us,&quot; said Tiglao, suggesting that the arbitration case provides an excuse for the United States to interfere in the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>Looking back, The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) charged the arbitral tribunal for the South China Sea case 2.85 million euros (3.16 million dollars ) for the secretarial service.</text:p><text:p>This was a sum all paid by Manila, including the share supposed to have been borne by Beijing, which had insisted on a stance of non-acceptance of and non-participation in the arbitration.</text:p><text:p>This cost is supposed to cover human labor and rents for office and office equipment, as well as possible payments to the five members of the arbitral tribunal, said Wang Hanling, a Chinese maritime law expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.</text:p><text:p>A gross sum of partial expenses can be traced on the basis of open data, Wang said. For instance, charges of secretarial service include openly-priced human labor, a single payment of 2,000 euros (2,218 dollars) for registration, and daily rent of office equipment at 1,750 euros (1,940 dollars), among other things, and the hearings room is charged at 1,000 euros (1,109 dollars) per day.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Such estimations can lead to a conclusion that the arbitrators pocketed largely the money Manila paid,&quot; Wang wrote in an article published on July 28 in China&apos;s Global Times newspaper.</text:p><text:p>The PCA charges are the only part made public of the expenses of the arbitration case, Wang said.</text:p><text:p>Setting a rare precedent in the history of international justice and arbitration by sweepingly siding with Manila&apos;s claims, the arbitral award has been widely questioned and challenged in the world. What&apos;s worse, it indicates something fishy about the arbitrators, Wang said.</text:p><text:p>Wang believes that certain countries such as the United States and Japan, and some organizations, probably have invested a great deal of money and resources in the South China Sea arbitration case, citing the first payment by some U.S. institutions.</text:p><text:p>However, what Manila finally gained from the arbitration case is nothing but a scrap of paper, instead of benefits, he said.</text:p><text:p>In this regard, it is necessary for Manila to open the records of expenses for the arbitration, so as to respond to the questions raise by the Philippine people and address the concerns of the international community, Wang concluded. </text:p><text:p>Related：</text:p><text:p>Philippines vows to engage &quot;concerned parties&quot; over South China Sea issue: FM</text:p><text:p>MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay said Friday the Philippines will continue to engage &quot;concerned parties&quot; as he raised the South China Sea issue at the meeting of the leaders from Asia and Europe in Mongolia. </text:p><text:p>The Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that Yasay briefed the leaders from Asia and Europe that an arbitral tribunal handed down the ruling on the sea dispute case that the Philippines filed in The Hague.  Full story</text:p><text:p>Spotlight: Former Philippine officials urge gov&apos;t to talk with China bilaterally, ignore arbitral ruling</text:p><text:p>by Wang Wen, Yang Tianmu MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine senior government officials Wednesday called on the Duterte administration to start bilateral talks with China immediately while ignoring the award issued by an ad hoc arbitral tribunal on the South China Sea issue Tuesday.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The negotiation must start immediately.

The statement said it was supposed to announce its reciprocal ceasefire declaration around 8 p.m. but Duterte announced the lifting of the government truce about an hour earlier.</text:p><text:p>Duterte demanded the communists to reciprocate the government truce on Saturday afternoon.

It was quite disconcerting that the GRP president would impose such an inflexible ultimatum on the CPP. Despite his anti-crime bravado, it would seem he has shown the drug lords and protectors of criminal syndicates more flexibility and accommodation,&quot;the CPP said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It is advisable for the GRP president to exercise a little more prudence and display more measured temperament as a way of appreciating the situation from a broader historical perspective in order to avoid such impulsive acts as imposing ultimatums by the hour on a conflict that has spanned nearly fifty years,&quot;it also said.</text:p><text:p>The CPP added that there was actually&quot;zero compliance&quot;to the ceasefire on the part of the AFP.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Its (AFP) public expression of support for the ceasefire declaration was not reflected on the ground. Not a single AFP command ordered its troops withdrawn back to their barracks,&quot;the CPP said.</text:p><text:p>Citing a report from the NPA unit involved in the Davao del Norte ambush, the CPP said NPA fighters were&quot; provoked to carry out the ambush as part of its active defense in the face of an imminent armed encounter with the operating armed troops and auxiliary forces of the 72nd IB (infantry battalion) of the AFP.&quot;</text:p><text:p>The NPA, the armed front of the Communist Party of the Philippines-National Democratic Front, has been waging war against the government for over four decades.</text:p><text:p>The communist rebellion has killed 30,000 people since 1960s, and the NPA is believed to have fewer than 4,000 men today, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s, according to the military. </text:p><text:p/>

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>by Wang Haiqing</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Monday starts a trip to China, after months of tension between the two countries as a result of Manila&apos;s headstrong arbitration quest on the South China Sea. Ramos&apos; visit brings a whiff of hope that the two countries will return to bilateral negotiations over the issue.</text:p><text:p>Ramos is probably the best choice for the job of breaking ice since he is a revered statesman widely respected in his own country and in Asia. His long history of friendly exchanges with China also gives him a unique advantage in helping revive chilly bilateral ties.</text:p><text:p>China has long insisted that the South China Sea disputes be resolved via bilateral talks and that parties involved refrain from moves that could further complicate the issue.</text:p><text:p>However, the Aquino administration, in disregard of regional consensus and his country&apos;s previous agreements with China, pushed for an ill-founded arbitration case with regard to its disputes with China over the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>The lengthy process, which culminated in an absurd ruling by an international tribunal on July 12, severely damaged not only the relations between China and the Philippines, but also the prospects of lasting peace in the vast body of waters surrounded by a number of Asian countries.</text:p><text:p>So it is really a relief that President Rodrigo Duterte, who was recently sworn in, chose to distance himself from the arbitration case and showed a series of positive gestures toward China.</text:p><text:p>That said, it is still worth mentioning that the Manila-initiated arbitration case is nothing more than an abuse of international law and the deeply biased ruling on the case should have no place whatsoever in future bilateral talks over the South China Sea issue between China and the Philippines.</text:p><text:p>Ramos&apos; visit, which represents the first concrete step on the Philippine side to engage in bilateral talks with China on the South China Sea, could open a new chapter in settling disputes.</text:p><text:p>But a return to the normal track of settlement depends largely on the sincerity of the Philippines. Decision makers in Manila should know that the fragile relations with Beijing could hardly take another hit. </text:p><text:p/><text:p/>

This growth was driven by stronger business confidence, low interest rates, and strong performance of the construction sector,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>He said public spending remained strong, driven by the boom in public construction and government consumption, which grew by 27.8 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively.</text:p><text:p>Similarly, he said private consumption grew stronger in comparison to the previous quarter and year due to the low inflation and interest rates, improved labor market conditions, and steady consumer confidence.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Overall, domestic demand growth accelerated to 12.3 percent from 12.0 percent in the first quarter of 2016,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>In contrast, Pernia said external demand weakened further, as exports of goods and services continue to slow down to 6.6 percent, despite the 15.3 percent growth of services exports.</text:p><text:p>Conversely, he said imports of goods rose to 22.9 percent largely due to increased purchases of captal goods and durable, which indicate an increase of investments from firms.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Services imports remained strong at 13.3 percent, significantly higher than the 10.3 percent in the previous quarter,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>On the supply side, Pernia said the acceleration of economic growth was &quot;fairly broad-based,&quot; adding the high growth recorded for the first quarter of this year was driven by gains in the industry and services sectors.</text:p><text:p>He said the industry sector recorded a growth of 6.9 percent, which is higher than the 6.1 percent growth in the previous year, supported by manufacturing, construction, and utilities.</text:p><text:p>He added that the services sector recorded an 8.4 percent growth fuelled by faster growth in trade, transport communication, public administration and real estate, renting and business activities.</text:p><text:p>In contrast to the robust industry and services, Pernia said the performance of the agriculture sector remains dismal at -2.1 percent due to the lingering effects of El Nino. He voiced concern over &quot;a developing risk of La Nina&quot; that will likely intensify between August and October this year.</text:p><text:p>&quot;This highlights the urgency of crafting holistic agriculture development policies that include disaster resiliency. This will benefit workers form the sector, which employs the biggest chunk of our labor force,&quot; he warned.</text:p><text:p>He further warned that despite the good numbers for the first six months of 2016, there is still a risk of seeing a lower growth rate in the second half of the year. &quot;This is a normal occurrence during election years. Consumer sentiment will also likely normalize given the post-election season.&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Over the medium-term, Pernia said the new administration is aiming still for a steady acceleration of growth towards 7 to 8 percent this year.</text:p><text:p>&quot;This will be supported by sustained reforms, including a comprehensive tax reform, sustained investment in infrastructure, easing of restriction of foreign investments, reduction of cost of doing business and strengthening of agro-industrial linkages,&quot; he said. </text:p><text:p/>

(Xinhua/Qin Qing)</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Tuesday that his country will no longer participate in joint patrols with the United States in the South China Sea, describing such patrols as &quot;a hostile act.&quot;</text:p><text:p>On Monday, Duterte said that U.S. special forces in southern Philippines should leave.</text:p><text:p>Such decisions and remarks by Duterte showed signs of subtle changes in the relationship between Manila and Washington.</text:p><text:p>Duterte&apos;s spat and confrontation with the U.S. began from the recently-concluded Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit.</text:p><text:p>On Sept. 5, Duterte said before flying to Laos to attend the summit that he is a leader of a sovereign country and is answerable only to the Filipino people.</text:p><text:p>He was answering a reporter&apos;s question about how he intends to explain the extrajudicial killings to U.S. President Barack Obama.

     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>by Xinhua writer Liu Chang</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is now in Beijing to warm up his country&apos;s ice-cold ties with China. The move has nothing to do with Manila&apos;s traditional alliance with Washington.</text:p><text:p>As Chinese President Xi Jinping rolled out red carpet to welcome his Philippine counterpart on Thursday morning, many around the world were predicting that the Southeast Asian nation was getting ready to pivot away from the United States, its traditional ally.</text:p><text:p>Some even said that Beijing would receive handsome gains if the Philippine-U.S. alliance truly gets weakened.h These observers are wrong although they think they have proofs as the new leader in Manila has been an open and fierce U.S. critic and threatened to cancel his country&apos;s joint military drills with U.S. armed forces.</text:p><text:p>The Chinese government never attempts to build up its ties with other countries on condition that these nations have to sacrifice their partnership with any third party.</text:p><text:p>To be more specific, the most important thing Beijing seeks to get from a sound bilateral relationship with the Philippines is that the two sides can work together to strengthen their economic and trade cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit as well as respect for each other&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</text:p><text:p>It&apos;s totally up to the Philippine authorities to decide how they are going to handle their relations with other parties, including the United States.</text:p><text:p>If America&apos;s partnership with the Philippines has indeed started to unravel, perhaps the very first thing politicians in Washington need to look into is their own way of doing business with the country they consider as a key ally in the Asia-Pacific region. And it is unfair and meaningless to scapegoat either China or Mr. Duterte.</text:p><text:p>They should also know that to sustain a partnership, they need to at least learn how to be respectful and stop being bossy.</text:p><text:p>Now that the Philippine leader is in China to fix the impaired ties, he will almost surely return home with his hands full as the two nations are expected to reach a series of agreements and step up their cooperation in areas such as fruits trade and anti-narcotics.</text:p><text:p>True friends need to be candid and honest. The visit is also a fine opportunity for the two governments to start their talks on the South China Sea dispute.</text:p><text:p>A proper handling of their maritime dispute, especially after the law-abusing arbitration episode that led bilateral ties to fall to a historical low, would build a solid foundation for the two countries to further their future cooperation without worrying that the island spats could relapse as time rolls on. </text:p><text:p/>

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>by Xinhua writer Liu Chang</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- In recent days, Washington seems to be agonizing over the colorful rhetoric of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, while its &quot;pivot to Asia&quot; policy faces even more uncertainties.</text:p><text:p>The United States believes that it has some sort of natural rights to write what outgoing President Barack Obama called &quot;the rules of the road&quot; for the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, it wants all nations in the region to observe that same playbook.</text:p><text:p>Yet without obedient partnerships underpinned by strong economic, military and security cooperation, America&apos;s such geopolitical arrangement could go nowhere.</text:p><text:p>In recent months, Washington has been troubled by a sense of worry.</text:p><text:p>Since Duterte took office in late June, the new leader in Manila has kept flashing out signals that have perplexed the Americans, if not enraging them. Perhaps the U.S. leaders have now begun to miss the &quot;good old days&quot; when former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III was in power.</text:p><text:p>Now that the Philippines has vowed to send all foreign troops home, including the U.S. forces stationed in the Southeastern Asian country, many are wondering how far Manila would go to push forward its independent foreign policy.</text:p><text:p>While the Philippines seems to be pivoting away, the bleak picture for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact has also raised qualms of America&apos;s allies in the region about Washington&apos;s determination and ability to close the deal.</text:p><text:p>The TPP is the economic magnet Washington tries to use to pull its regional partners together and to bolster its economic leadership in the Asia-Pacific. Its failure to be materialized, which now seems very likely, would sink the re-balance to Asia strategy deep down into the waves of the Pacific.</text:p><text:p>Though Beijing has repeatedly promised to seek peaceful development, the suspicious and stubborn Washington still tries to counterbalance it.</text:p><text:p>In his recent article published in the Foreign Affairs magazine, Ashton Carter, U.S. defense chief, criticized Beijing for being &quot;out of step with where the Asia-Pacific wants to go.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Considering America&apos;s intention to call the shots in the region, the secretary could probably really mean &quot;where Washington wants to go.&quot;</text:p><text:p>The rapprochement between Beijing and Manila has gotten on the nerves of the U.S. government. That may explain why U.S. Navy destroyer Decatur intruded earlier this month the waters of China&apos;s Xisha Islands in the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>At the very root of Washington&apos;s growing solicitude are its self-serving and arrogant ambition to maintain global hegemony and worries that its days of being the world&apos;s only superpower are in a ticking countdown.</text:p><text:p>If the United States wants to get rid of the anxieties, it has to find its rightful place in the Asia-Pacific and the wider world, and starts to act more constructively, not coercively. Obsession with the vain dream of building a long-lasting global empire could ultimately turn its nightmares into reality. </text:p><text:p>Related:</text:p><text:p>Commentary: Time for Washington to self-question its Asia-Pacific policy</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- In the countdown to a farewell to the White House and prior to perhaps his last visit to Asia as a sitting U.S. president, Barack Obama should reflect upon his policies that failed to contribute to regional peace and stability.</text:p><text:p>Obama starts a weeklong trip to Vietnam and Japan on Sunday.Full Story</text:p><text:p>Commentary: U.S. self-serving Asia policy is root cause of regional tension</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- It is regrettable that some U.S. politicians should take as priority the South China Sea issue at Monday&apos;s special summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</text:p><text:p>According to Ben Rhodes, Obama&apos;s deputy national security adviser, the U.S. president will deliver a &quot;tough message&quot; to China, which he hinted is a troublemaker that bullies smaller neighbors over the South China Sea issue.Full Story</text:p><text:p/>

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>MANILA, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- An unknown, self-taught artist who painted a portrait of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is slowly getting noticed in the media and in the art world.</text:p><text:p>Mart Henry Bongabong, 31, a college dropout, said in a recent interview that he still could not believe that the portrait he painted is now hanging in the reception hall of the Malacanang presidential palace alongside the presidential portraits of past Philippine leaders painted by famous Philippine artists.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Never in my wildest dreams did I think that one day my painting, a portrait of a Philippine president, would end up hanging in the historic walls of the palace,&quot; he told Xinhua in a telephone interview.</text:p><text:p>Unlike nationally recognized artists, Bongabong managed to hone his skills without the luxury of having an art school background. A lack of finances forced him to drop out of college because his father, a fisherman, and mother, a housewife, could not afford to send all six of their children to school. When he was growing up, he said he helped his father mend fishing nets to help supplement the family&apos;s income.</text:p><text:p>The family moved a number of times in Mindanao, an island in the southern Philippines, to look for greener pastures. When their parents died, the siblings decided to live where they could find work. Bongabong had decided to make Davao City his home after hearing &quot;a lot of good things&quot; that Duterte had been doing to keep the city safe.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I didn&apos;t go to a fine arts school. I am just an ordinary artist, a son of a poor fisherman from Zamboanga, yet my artwork is now on display in the palace alongside other Philippine national artists like (Fernando) Amorsolo,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Until now, Bongabong said he could not believe that his oil painting on a 30-inch by 40-inch linen canvass of Duterte was selected over works by many more popular painters.</text:p><text:p>Bongabong&apos;s portrait depicts a compassionate president. Bongabong painted Duterte&apos;s head just very slightly rose, showing pride yet with a smile on his face. &quot;I portrayed him as someone who is approachable and humble,&quot; Bongabong said. &quot;I guess my hard work paid off.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Bongabong, knows as Macky to his friends, is virtually unknown in the art world. Except for some friends and clients who go to his fine arts kiosk inside a shopping mall in Davao, Duterte&apos;s home city, Bongabong said nobody really knows his work.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Who would have thought that someone would notice my talent as a painter?&quot; Bongabong said.</text:p><text:p>It all started sometime in August when a staff from the Office of the President dropped a note to Bongabong&apos;s rented kiosk in a shopping mall in Davao.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I was nervous when I saw the stationery that said Office of the President Manila. I called the mobile number written on it and heard the good news. I was being asked to do a portrait of our beloved president. I was nervous and excited at the same time,&quot; he recalled.</text:p><text:p>Bongabong said the task was scary for someone who has no formal training in painting.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I could feel the tremendous pressure on my shoulders. But I accepted the challenge. I didn&apos;t want my insecurities to get in the way,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>The Office of the President emailed Duterte&apos;s photo to Bongabong &quot;for guidance.&quot;</text:p><text:p>For the next 30 days, Bongabong said he was sketching, painting and mixing colors on his palette to create a &quot;natural&quot; Duterte. &quot;I made sure that the colors popped,&quot; he said, adding that he wanted the painting to be &quot;alive.&quot;</text:p><text:p>He considers the portrait painting to be his greatest work so far, earning glowing compliments from the palace. &quot;I was told my portrait was both natural and vibrant,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>He added, &quot;I consider it a labor of love. Every single day for a month I was happy to wake up and paint somebody I know, I respect and look up to. Plus I think the emotions that I put into it, my life struggles and experiences went into every inch of detail with each brush stroke.</text:p><text:p>On Oct. 16, Bongabong personally presented the portrait painting to Duterte at the Davao international airport before the leader left for his state visits to Brunei and China.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I cried. I was overwhelmed when I saw him. I was awed. He was very soft-spoken. He even joked that he would commission my team again for more paintings,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It was a gift of love to President Duterte who we consider a tatay (father),&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>After their meeting that lasted several minutes, Bongabong said Duterte invited him for dinner at the palace a few days later. It would be Bongabong&apos;s first time to set foot in the official residence and principal workplace of Philippine presidents.</text:p><text:p>Also invited to the dinner were his two apprentices, Keren Hanhah Golea and sister Krystle Ann Golea who also gave Duterte a charcoal painting of Duterte kissing his mother&apos;s hands. Golea&apos;s charcoal painting is also now hanging on the walls of Bahay Pangarap just across from the palace where Duterte lives when he is in Manila.</text:p><text:p>Bongabong remembered his first fleeting encounter with then Davao City Mayor Duterte back in 2013. He said he and his friends went up to him at the mall and requested a photo to which the former mayor readily agreed. Little did he know that three years later he would be invited to have dinner with Duterte at the palace.</text:p><text:p>He said he is looking forward to the dinner with Duterte. &quot;I cannot ask for more. If that happens then I will just thank him again for appreciating my work and for giving me the opportunity to paint his portrait. It&apos;s a real honor and a privilege,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Bongabong has indeed come a long way.</text:p><text:p>From the rural fishing village of Zamboanga, the bachelor who runs a small art shop in a shopping mall will share dinner with the 71-year-old Duterte, the Philippines&apos; 16th president and the first president from Mindanao.</text:p><text:p>Duterte is now immortalized in an official portrait that now hangs in the halls of power where artworks of known Filipino artists are also on display.</text:p><text:p>Bongabong&apos;s advice to aspiring painters is encouraging. &quot;Appreciate what you have and use it. Love your work and keep practicing to hone your skills. Always give it your best. Being poor is not hindrance,&quot; the artist said. </text:p><text:p/>

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>MANILA, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday to allow the remains of ousted former President Ferdinand Marcos to be buried in the heroes&apos; cemetery in Manila, hopefully ending more than two decades of dispute that continued to divide Filipinos.</text:p><text:p>Voting 9-5, court spokesperson Theodore Te told a news conference that the court dismissed all petitions to ban Marcos burial in the cemetery.</text:p><text:p>The high court found that &quot;there is no law that prohibits the burial of Marcos in the heroes&apos; cemetery,&quot; and that Marcos qualifies to be interred in the cemetery because &quot;he was a former president, he was a commander in chief, he was a former soldier, medal of valor awardee, former legislator, (and) secretary of national defense,&quot; Te said.</text:p><text:p>Moreover, the court said that Marcos &quot;had not been convicted of crime involving moral turpitude.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The court said that the cases cited by the petitioners which were cases abroad were all civil in nature and therefore he has not been convicted by any final judgment involving moral turpitude,&quot; Te said.</text:p><text:p>The Marcoses hailed the ruling. Former Senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. thanked President Rodrigo Duterte, a close friend and ally of the Marcoses.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Our family will forever be thankful for his kind gesture,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It is our sincerest hope that this will lead the nation towards healing as we endeavor to move the country forward to give every Filipino a better life,&quot; said Marcos Jr.</text:p><text:p>Marcos Jr. also added that the Marcos family is &quot;deeply grateful&quot; to the Supreme Court for its decision to allow the burial of Marcos at the cemetery.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Once again, the Supreme Court has taken a magnanimous act to uphold the rule of law,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>Marcos Jr. said his family will start finalizing the date for his father&apos;s interment.</text:p><text:p>An anti-Marcos petitioners said in a statement that they are &quot;disappointed, heartbroken and outraged by the decision.&quot;</text:p><text:p>&quot;With this decision, the courts have tramped on the graves of the true heroes of this country. They have trampled on the memory of those who have died defending our freedom, our rights, and our very identity as Filipinos,&quot; the anti-Marcos group said.</text:p><text:p>The group added that the Supreme Court has &quot;subjected those who suffered and died under Marcos&apos;s orders to a new death once again, robbing them the sole consolation they have had: that their deaths were not in vain, that they died protecting a nation, that they died heroes.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Anti-Marcos groups, most of them torture victims locked up in jails when Marcos imposed martial law in 1972, filed a petition before the court to oppose the burial, arguing that Marcos is not a hero and does not deserve a plot in the cemetery reserved only for heroes.</text:p><text:p>They further argued that thousands of Filipinos suffered and were stripped of their rights during the Marcos dictatorship.</text:p><text:p>Citing a law that allows the interment of presidents and soldiers without distinction on whether they were heroes or not, the Marcos family and their lawyers argued that Marcos is a former president and soldier and therefore is eligible for ground burial at the cemetery.</text:p><text:p>Marcos loyalists led by Marcos&apos; daughter, Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos and anti-Marcos protesters held separate rallies outside the court when the verdict was announced.</text:p><text:p>Last Sunday, former President Benigno Aquino, whose father was incarcerated by Marcos, attended an anti-Marcos prayer-cum-concert rally to remind the people about the oppressive Marcos rule. He described a burial of Marcos among heroes as &quot;desecration&quot; of the national heroes&apos; cemetery.</text:p><text:p>The next day, Imee Marcos, lit candles, fingered her rosary and led a prayer vigil in front of the high court. She insisted that her father has the right to be buried in the cemetery.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Let&apos;s bury Marcos so the country will heal, become united, and the Philippines would be able to move on,&quot; she told reporters.</text:p><text:p>Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a close friend and ally of the Marcoses, has given the go-ahead for the body of disgraced Marcos to be buried in the Heroes&apos; Cemetery.</text:p><text:p>Marcos&apos;s embalmed body is currently on display in his home city of Batac in Ilocos Norte province, north of Manila, a known bailiwick of the Marcoses.</text:p><text:p>Marcos was elected in 1965, but declared martial law in 1972. Millions of Filipinos took to the streets in February 1986, deposing Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The Marcoses was forced to flee to Hawaii where the elder Marcos died in 1989. His body was bought back to the Philippines in 1993.</text:p><text:p>The Marcos family has long lobbied for an honorable burial in the heroes&apos; cemetery. But the anti-Marcos and human rights groups had vehemently opposed the plan, saying the disgraced leader does not deserve a military honor and a plot in the hallowed ground. Enditem</text:p><text:p/>
