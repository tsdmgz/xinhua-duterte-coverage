 Philippine president issues ultimatum to leftist rebels for declaration of ceasefire



MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte issued Friday an ultimatum to the leftist rebel group to reciprocate the government's own ceasefire.
During a visit to the government troops in Davao del Norte, Duterte said he would give the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front until 5:00 p.m. local time on Saturday.
"So, I'm asking you, are you ready to declare ceasefire or not, I will wait for your declaration until 5:00 p.m. tomorrow," he said.
The president said if the leftist rebel group failed to reciprocate the truce by Saturday afternoon, he would lift the government's unilateral ceasefire.
Duterte declared the truce on Monday during his first State of the Nation Address.
On Thursday, he demanded an explanation from the CPP-NPA-NDF regarding the attack of the rebels on government militiamen in Davao del Norte, killing one of them and wounding four others.
But the leftist rebel group claimed their fighters only "thwarted" the offensive by the paramilitary.
The NPA has been waging war against the government for over four decades. The left rebellion has killed 30,000 people since 1960s, and the NPA is believed to have fewer than 4,000 men today, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s, according to the military.
