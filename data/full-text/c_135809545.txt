 Philippine gov't likens Pacquiao's victory on fight against illegal drugs




MANILA, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government congratulated Sunday Filipino boxing icon Senator Emmanuel "Manny" Pacquiao for defeating Jessie Vargas in a bout in Las Vegas as it likened the lawmaker's determination on the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte's seriousness to eliminate illegal drugs.
"Once again, Manny's triumph united and brought joy to our people and our nation," Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar said in a statement.
He said the discipline, the determination, and the hard work of "our People's Champ are truly what make him a National Treasure in Global Sports."
Pacquiao regained the World Boxing Organization welterweight title via a unanimous decision from the three judges during the fight held at the Thomas and Mack Center Arena.
Aside from Pacquiao, Filipino boxer Nonito Donaire also fought in an undercard bout. But he lost to Mexican Jessie Magdaleno. However, Andanar said Donaire's defeat would not diminish the honors he bestowed to the people and to the flag.
"The courage and grit displayed by our Filipino boxers in Las Vegas are the same qualities we must demonstrate as a nation to rid society of drugs, criminality and corruption," he said.
The official said the Duterte administration has been successfully waging a war on these fronts and "we as a people - emulating our boxers' toughness against all odds - must continue the strong gains as we battle towards victory."
Statistics released by the police recently said 1,790 drug suspects have been killed since President Rodrigo Duterte launched the campaign when he assumed power on June 30. At least 3,000 others have been reportedly killed by unidentified vigilantes.
