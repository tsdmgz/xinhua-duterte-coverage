 Aquino hopes Bangsamoro Basic Law be approved under Duterte administration



MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III said Thursday that he remained hopeful of passage of the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) in the next Congress under the administration of incoming President Rodrigo Duterte.
"There is a long way to go, and many of us who worked so hard for peace are fearful, apprehensive and unsure. It is true that the culmination of our efforts has been delayed. Today, however, I ask you to remember and take strength from the progress we have made," Aquino said in a speech in the launching of the Government of the Philippines-Moro Islamic Liberation Front (GPH-MILF) Peace Process.
The passage of the proposed BBL is part of the peace agreement signed by the Aquino administration and the Muslim rebel group in March 2014. Its enactment did not push through due to many questionable provisions.
Aquino cited the importance of continuing the peace process with the MILF, including the approval of the BBL.
He said that from 2010 to 2015, total actual investments in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) amounted to 14.3 billion pesos (310.67 million U.S. dollars) as compared to 87.9 million pesos in 2010 and 6.58 billion pesos in 2015.
ARMM is the core territory for the proposed Bangsamoro region under the draft BBL.
Duterte has said that he would push for a federal government, covering also ARMM. His appointed leader in the House of Representatives said this would make the passage of the BBL moot and academic.
