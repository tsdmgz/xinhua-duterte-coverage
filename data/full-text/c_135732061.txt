 1st LD Writethru: Philippine president threatens to "break up" with U.S.



MANILA, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte
said on Tuesday that he would "eventually" cut ties with the United
States.

Duterte again hit out at the United States and its president,
the European Union and the United Nations for using human rights to
criticize his campaign to curb the illicit drug menace in the
Philippines.

"I am very emotional because America has certainly failed us,"
Duterte added.

"I will be re-configuring my foreign policy," Duterte said in a
speech before the Jewish Association of the Philippines in Makati
City.

He added, "Eventually I might in my time break up with America.
I would rather go to Russia and to China. "

"I would like to make it (clear) now, here and now, that there

the central Philippines. Enditem
