 Illegal party drugs from Netherlands seized in Philippines



MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine authorities have confiscated 3-million Philippine peso (65,337 U.S. dollars) worth of ecstacy or so-called party drugs from the Netherlands and arrested its recipient, the Bureau of Customs said Thursday.
Acting based on derogatory information, the Customs Anti-Illegal Drug Task Force (CAIDTF) confirmed the arrival recently at the Manila Post Office of 2,009 pieces of orange tablets, which was positively found to contain three methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) -- a dangerous drug under Republic Act No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).
Having found the presence of such substance, CAIDTF officers coordinated a "controlled delivery" operation with PDEA to monitor its course from the post office to its ultimate consignee.
The group's commissioner Ariel Nepomuceno said the seizure of ecstacy and apprehension of the suspect were a clear manifestation of the BOC's commitment to eradicating illegal drugs, which is in line with one of the priorities of President-elect Rodrigo Duterte.
Five people died last month in a concert in Philippine capital after allegedly taking illegal drugs and alcoholic drinks.
