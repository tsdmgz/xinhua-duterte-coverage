 Philippine Supreme Court issues order to hold plan to bury Marcos in heroes' cemetery



MANILA, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court issued on Tuesday an order temporarily barring the burial of late president Ferdinand Marcos in the heroes' cemetery for the next 20 days.
Theodore Te, spokesman for the supreme court, said the 15-member high court also decided to move the scheduled oral arguments on Wednesday to Aug. 31 as the court consolidates the five petitions filed by different anti-Marcos groups opposing the burial of Marcos in the heroes' cemetery in Manila.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has allowed the burial of Marcos in the heroes' cemetery, stirring up an old debate on whether or not Marcos deserves the honor.
The administration said no date has been set yet for the Marcos burial, but Marcos's son said the interment of Marcos might happen on Sept. 18.
