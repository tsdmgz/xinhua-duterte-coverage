 Philippine gov't, Moro rebel group to re-launch peace engagements: official



MANILA, Aug. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are set to re-launch the two parties' engagements for the implementation of the two-year-old Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) this week, the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process said Thursday.
The formal meeting to be held on August 13 to August 14 in Kuala Lumpur will be the first under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.
Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza said the scheduled meeting is crucial as the two sides are entering the implementation phase of the peace agreement.
"This (meeting) is actually to launch the implementation stage of what we envisioned to be a Bangsamoro enabling law. It is to implement the CAB that was signed between the government and the MILF in 2014," he said.
"We have already gotten the consensus of all sectors in the Bangsamoro that the period of the negotiations is over. We are now in the process of implementing all these signed agreements," he added.
Dureza said the meeting in Kuala Lumpur would zero-in on the mechanism that will determine how the new enabling law will be crafted, as well as to discuss key provisions in the CAB that can already be implemented, including the delivery of socio-economic development programs in Mindanao.
The implementation of the peace agreement with the MILF largely depends on its political track since the Bangsamoro Basic Law, the supposed implementing mechanism of the CAB, failed to pass in the previous Congress.
