 Philippine poll body bars female senator to run for president



MANILA, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Commission on Elections (Comelec) en banc has upheld the disqualification of a female senator to run for president in the 2016 elections, a poll official said Wednesday.
Senator Grace Poe has been disqualified to run for president for failing to meet the constitutional requirements of a candidate, being a natural-born Filipino and a resident of the Philippines for at least 10 years on the day of the elections, said Comelec chairman Andres Bautista.
But Poe, whose qualification as a senator is also being questioned, can appeal the Comelec's decision before the Supreme Court.
The female senator is a foundling and was adopted only by famous actor and actress couple in the country. She was an American citizen before she decided to run and won in the Philippine Senate in 2010.
In the latest survey, Poe tied with Vice President Jejomar Binay as the top presidential contenders, edging former Local Government Secretary Manuel Roxas II, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, and Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago.
