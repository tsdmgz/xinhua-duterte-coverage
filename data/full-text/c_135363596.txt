 Philippine presumptive president-elect to offer cabinet posts to leftists



MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine presumptive President-elect Rodrigo Duterte said Monday that he would offer some cabinet posts to members of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
Duterte, in a televised news conference from Davao City, said he would ask the leftists to lead the agencies such as the Departments of Agrarian Reform, Environment and Natural Resources, Labor and Employment or Social Welfare and Development.
"Those are the only departments that I can concede to them," he said.
When he was still campaigning for presidency, Duterte had been keeping in touch with CPP founding Chairman Jose Ma. Sison, who has been in exile in the Netherlands.
He was also planning to resume the peace process with the leftist group. The formal peace talks with the CPP-New People's Army- National Democratic Front bogged down in 2011 under the Aquino administration.
Duterte said he would appoint Jesus Dureza as his peace adviser, while party-list Representative Silvestre Bello III as the chief negotiator with the leftist group.
