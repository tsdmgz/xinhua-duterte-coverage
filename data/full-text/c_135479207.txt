 Indonesian, Philippine FMs to meet on release of hostages



JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Foreign Ministry has continued its efforts to release seven Indonesian seamen held hostage by Abu Sayyaf terrorist group in southern Philippines.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi will hold a meeting with her Philippine counterpart Perfecto Yasay in Manila on Friday, spokesman of Indonesian Foreign Ministry Armanatha Nasir said on Thursday.
"The topic (of releasing hostage) will certainly be on the agenda in their meeting," he said.
The meeting will be held one day after Rodrigo Duterte was sworn in as the new Philippine president.
Minister Retno said whereabouts of the seven Indonesian hostages have been discovered, adding that all of them, which initially were divided into two groups, have been placed in one location.
Earlier this week, Indonesian Defense Minister Ryamizar Ryacudu met with his Philippine counterpart Voltaire Gasmin in Manila, agreeing to allow Indonesian military to enter into the Philippine territory in the next hostage situation.
The seven crews of Tugboat Charles 001 and Robby barge ship 152, were abducted in the Sulu Sea off southern Philippines on June 20.
That is the third abduction of Indonesian nationals in the waters between the two neighbors this year.
The incident took place after the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines reached an agreement last month to conduct a joint patrol to secure waterways on their borders.
