 Philippine gov't employees to take mandatory drug tests



MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government is open for mandatory drug testing of its over 1.5 million employees to regain the trust of the public, a senior government official said Saturday.
There were calls from some quarters to allow government employees to also undergo drug testing amid the intensified campaign of the new administration of President Rodrigo Duterte against illegal drugs.
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella, in an interview over a state-run radio station, said the proposal was a welcome development "just to prove to the people that all government workers are proper."
He said that undergoing mandatory drug testing of government employees would be a "very powerful symbolic act" to show that they are people "worthy of our trust."
Shells said that it has been the priority of the President to bring back the public's trust and faith in the government.
Duterte has promised to address criminality, including the proliferation of illegal drugs, and corruption within three to six months of his administration.
He has ordered an investigation against five retired and active police generals whom he publicly named for their alleged involvement in illegal drugs in the country.
