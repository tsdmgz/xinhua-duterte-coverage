MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Benigno Aquino III confirmed Tuesday a "raw" information regarding a possible bomb attack in southern Philippine city of Davao.
Aquino told reporters that he passed on to Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte the raw information to adequately prepare the city. The attack is said to be perpetrated by a terrorist with international links.
"The reports stated and I emphasize, the raw report stated that this terrorist who is a bomb maker had sent a bomb or a bomb-laden vehicle to Davao City to further a terrorist attack," he said.
Despite the raw information, he said the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines are actively determining the validity of the report and continuing operations against the known terrorist.
The President indicated that the raw information was connected to the recent arrest in Paranaque City, Metro Manila of a high- ranking official of terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group, Khair Mundos, who was also on the terror watch list of the United States.
"So at the present time, he is already under custody and we are still following up all of the available leads to ensure the safety of everybody in the Philippines," he said.
