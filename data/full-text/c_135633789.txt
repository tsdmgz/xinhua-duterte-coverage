 Philippine gov't expects extension of unilateral truce by leftist rebels



MANILA, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is expecting the leftist rebel group to extend its ongoing seven-day unilateral ceasefire in response to the "smooth and cordial" talks, a senior government official said Thursday.
Silvestre Bello III,the Philippine labor minister and head of the government negotiating team, said if the "body language" of their counterpart from the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Atmy-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) is to be considered, "all indications" point to prolonging the truce.
"Although, of course, the decision remains with them (NDF)," Bello said.
NDF peace panel head Fidel Agcaoili, however, said they have yet to decide on the possibility of extending their ceasefire declaration.
The CCP has declared a unilateral ceasefire from Aug. 21 to 27 while President Rodrigo Duterte issued a unilateral open-ended ceasefire starting Aug. 21. The respective sets of truce were declared as formal peace talks have been ongoing in Oslo, Norway.
Bello also said both sides have agreed to accelerate the peace talks with the hope to forge a final peace pact after a year.
"We are right on schedule and the talks are proceeding smoothly. We expect a final peace agreement after one year so we can devote five more years of President Rodrigo Duterte's term in implementing the reforms agreed upon by both parties," he said.
The CPP-NPA-NDF has been waging war against the government for over four decades.
