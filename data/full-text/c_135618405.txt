 Duterte's spokesman says UN, int'l bodies not welcome to probe killings



MANILA, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- The spokesman of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Saturday that international representatives are not welcome to probe the alleged spate of drug-related extra-judicial killings in the country.
Reacting to a tweet by UN special rapporteur on summary executions Agnes Callamard, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the Philippine government has not sent out invitation to any third party to look into the Philippines' state affairs.
Abella said in a statement that Duterte "finds the pronouncements from certain bodies as unwelcome meddling in national matters."
"The drug situation is being responsibly addressed by Philippine authorities, and so-called investigations by third parties are objectionable interference in the household affairs of a nation whose citizens welcome the change that the president and his people friendly policies and programs being set in place," Abella said.
Abella's statement came in the wake of Callamard's statement that she had accepted the challenge posed by Duterte's chief presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo to see for herself the drug situation in the country.
But Abella stressed there was no invitation for Callamard or any representative from a third party has been sent out.
International human rights groups have voiced concern over the spate of killings of suspected drug suspects in the country. The media have tallied nearly 700 killings since Duterte took over the presidency since June 30.
