 Philippine vice president appointed as housing secretary



MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte
has appointed Vice President Leni Robredo as head of the housing
agency, a senior government official said Thursday.

Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre said the president called up
Robredo and offered her to be the head of the Housing and Urban
Development Coordinating Council, a position also held by former
Vice President Jejomar Binay, with a Cabinet rank.

Robredo, in a separate statement, accepted the offer and thanked
Duterte for her appointment.

She said she can better serve the poor Filipinos, particularly
those who are homeless, with her concurrent position.

Duterte earlier declined to give Robredo a Cabinet position as
respect to his "friend," former Senator Ferdinand Marcos who ran
and lost to Robredo by a margin of only about 200,000 votes in the
May polls.

Prior to appointing Robredo, the two leaders had met twice since
they assumed office on June 30. Enditem
