17 dead in S. Philippine flash flood







DAVAO CITY, Philippines, June 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people have been killed and up to ten others reported missing as of Wednesday since a flash flood "of epic proportions" swept parts of southern Philippines Tuesday night.
Rescue operations still continue on Wednesday as floodwaters have started subsiding, according to regional police spokesperson Gretchin Cinco.
"The waters reached up to ten feet, submerging houses and trapping many residents," Cinco told Xinhua by phone. She added rescuers from the military's Eastern Mindanao Command, the Philippine Coast Guard and other volunteer groups were immediately mobilized.
The overflowing of Matina River which traverses the entire district aggravated the disaster. Davao City Mayor Sarah Duterte said at least 15,000 families were displaced by the sudden flood, which, according to residents, was spawned by a two-hour heavy downpour.
