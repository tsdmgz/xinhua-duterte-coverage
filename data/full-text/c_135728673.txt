 3 Indonesian hostages freed in S. Philippines



MANILA, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- The terrorist group Abu Sayyaf has released three more Indonesian hostages in southern Philippine province of Sulu, a senior government official said Sunday.
Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza said the Indonesian fishermen were turned over by Nur Misuari, founding chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front, to Sulu Governor Abdusakur Tan II before Sunday noon.
"Chairman Misuari personally called me and informed me about another breakthrough in the efforts to recover hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf Group," he said, adding that Misuari asked him to relay to President Rodrigo Duterte the new development.
He said Tan confirmed to him that he has physical custody of the three Indonesians and would be turned over to the military.
Dureza said the freed Indonesians were among those Indonesian fishermen who were abducted in July off Lahad Datu in Sabah.
He said the ongoing military operations helped in pressuring the Abu Sayyaf to release the hostages.
Last month, three other Indonesian fishermen were also freed by the Abu Sayyaf bandits.
Around 10 local and foreign hostages have remained in the hands of the local terrorist group.
