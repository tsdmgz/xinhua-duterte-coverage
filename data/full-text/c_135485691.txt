 5 drug suspects killed in Philippine capital



MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Five suspects allegedly involved in illegal drugs were killed Sunday in an encounter with policemen in the Philippine capital.
Law enforcers received information about a group of malefactors allegedly responsible for the transportation of illegal drugs in Quiapo, Manila, the National Capital Region Police Office said.
Police then conducted a surveillance and casing operation in the area; however, several men allegedly fired upon them.
An exchange of fire later led to the death of the five unidentified suspects.
Recovered from the scene were four pistols and about 200 grams of suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu.
Philippine new president Rodrigo Duterte has declared a war against illegal drugs, even tapping military help in fighting the menace.
