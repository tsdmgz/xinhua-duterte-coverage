 Incoming Duterte administration mulls using cable cars to ease Metro traffic



MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The administration of the President-elect Rodrigo Duterte is mulling to use cable cars to ease the crippling traffic in Metro Manila, his aide said Tuesday.
Incoming Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said in a TV interview that installing cable cars similar to that in Bolivia is"being seriously looking into" by the Duterte administration.
In fact, he said that he has already started initial talks with the officials of the company that could build the project. He said that the cable cars can be operational in just 18 months.
He stressed the need to explore the space above since the roads that are criss-crossing the metropolis of 12 million people are clogged, making it more difficult to build more roads.
He said they are exploring the possibilities of installing cable cars that could bring commuters to the central business district of Makati City.
Duterte, who will assume power on June 30, said he will ask Congress for"special powers"to solve the debilitating traffic that has reached "crisis" proportions.
A study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency said the Philippines loses an estimated 2.4 billion pesos (51.06 million U.S. dollars) a day due to traffic congestion.
