 Philippines to meet goal of 6 mln foreign tourists this year



MANILA, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government expressed optimism on Thursday that it can meet its target of welcoming 6 million foreign tourists this year.
Department of Tourism (DOT) Secretary Wanda Teo said in a statement that the target could be achieved because as of July, the number of foreign tourists who visited the country was about 3 million already.
"So we will hit the target or even more," she said.
The DOT chief said her office would even be more aggressive on its campaign and it would push for more tourism infrastructure.
She also said the government's tourism slogan of "It's more fun in the Philippines," which the Aquino administration used, would be replaced by the middle of next year.
Teo said the DOT has tapped an advertising firm to come up with a proposal.
"It's more on change. We would like to show them that we have a new Philippines," she explained why the Duterte administration would change the slogan.
The Philippines is also set to host the Miss Universe pageant in January next year.
