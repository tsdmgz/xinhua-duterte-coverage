 Indonesia, Philippines to hold high level meeting to discuss hostage release: minister



JAKARTA, Aug.1 (Xinhua) -- Senior Indonesian officials were scheduled to meet Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in the near future to discuss ways in releasing Indonesian hostages in the Philippines, a senior Indonesian minister said on Monday.
Indonesia's newly-appointed Coordinating Minister for Security, Politics and Legal Affairs Wiratno said that the upcoming Indonesia-the Philippines top level meeting would also discuss bilateral relations between the two neighboring countries.
"There would be a joint agreement on the establishment of a joint task force to particularly handle the hostage situation," Wiranto said.
Former Indonesian military commander Wiranto was appointed by Indonesian president through a cabinet reshuffle to replace Luhut Pandjaitan who is now serving as the Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs.
Luhut previously said Duterte would visit Indonesia with a mission to discuss further handling in releasing Indonesian vessel crews taken hostages for ransom by Philippine rebel group of Abu Sayyaf.
In Duterte's upcoming visit to Indonesia, Luhut said that Duterte would be accompanied by Nur Misuari, the co-founder of Philippine's political faction of Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), who has communication access to Abu Sayyaf.
Nur Misuari had a pivotal role in the release of Indonesian hostages previously kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf group.
Ten Indonesians were still kept by Abu Sayyaf group in several camps.
