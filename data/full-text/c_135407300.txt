 Philippines tightens security for incoming Philippine president's thanksgiving party: senior official



MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine security forces will tighten security measures in southern city of Davao to make sure incoming president Rodrigo Duterte's thanksgiving party could be carried out smoothly, a senior official said Thursday.
Earlier reports said members of Islamic extremists group Khalifa Islamiyah were spotted in Davao.
Herminio Coloma, Communications Secretary, said the Philippine National Police (PNP) headquarters maintained that it had no specific information about the group's presence in Davao but police and military forces are closely monitoring the situation.
"The AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) and PNP are constantly monitoring all security threats and stand ready to repulse these to ensure the safety of citizenry," said Coloma.
The PNP-Davao City office made public the photographs of 22 alleged Khalifa Islamiyah members following reports that some members of the group were seen in Davao City.
The Khalifa Islamiyah, reportedly the local allies of the Islamic State, is allegedly involved in some of the bombing incidents in parts of Mindanao like Cotabato and Cagayan and kidnappings including the Samal abduction last year.
A joint session of the Philippine Congress on Monday proclaimed Duterte as the new Philippine president, over 20 days after the May 9 elections.
Duterte, also the incumbent Davao city mayor, will take over from President Benigno Aquino on June 30 as the country's 16th president.
He will hold a 12-hour thanksgiving party on Saturday at the sprawling Crocodile Park in Davao. The party, dubbed as "Du31: One Love, One Nation Thanksgiving Party," expects participation of more than 100,000 people.
