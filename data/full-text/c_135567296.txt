 Japan FM to visit Philippines for security talks next week



TOKYO, Aug. 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said Friday that he will visit the Philippines from Aug. 10 to discuss security issues.
Kishida said at a press conference that he will meet Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and Philippines Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay during the three-day visit.
"It is important to communicate with the new Philippines government. I would like to firmly confirm friendly ties," Kishida was quoted as saying.
Kashida is expected to talk with his Philippine counterpart about a variety of security issues, including Japan's provision of patrol vessels to the Philippines.
Kashida's visit came after an ad hoc arbitral tribunal with judges mostly picked by Shunji Yanai, a Japanese right-winger, issued a biased and illegal award over the South China Sea dispute.
Japan is not a concerned party in the South China Sea but constantly meddled in the issue despite China's protests.
