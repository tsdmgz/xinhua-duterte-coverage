presence of U.S. troops in the southern Philippine region, saying it could only 
aggravate the conflict there, reported local daily Philippine Star on Wednesday. 

    Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Davao City, the third largest city in the 
Philippines, said the U.S. troops participating in joint military exercises in 
parts of Mindanao has worsened the tension brought about by the recent bombings 
in Davao del Sur and CotabatoCity. 
    Duterte said he has nothing against the Americans but he is against their 
presence. 
    "The presence of these American soldiers is a magnet to the Islmic 
militants who are really up against anything American," he was quoted as saying 
in the report. 
    He also said the separatist problem in Mindanao is a long drawn one and 
could not be solved by military might alone, like the way the U.S. invaded Iraq, 
according to the report. 
    He said it would be the best to leave Filipinos alone to solve whatever 
conflicts they are facing, according to the report.
