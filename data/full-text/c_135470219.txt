 Incoming Philippine president vows for three-child policy



MANILA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President-elect Rodrigo Duterte said Monday that he would push for a three-child policy to address the ballooning population.
Duterte, in a speech during his attendance in his last flag-raising ceremony as mayor of Davao City, said his administration would revive the family planning policy that was openly supported by the administration of then President Fidel Ramos despite a strong opposition by the Catholic Church.
"I will reinstall the program of family planning. One, two, three (children), that's enough," he said, adding that the country's population, which has reached 100 million, is "no longer realistic."
Duterte said that the social workers must be proactive and they "better shape up" in implementing the program.
The 71-year old incoming president said that he is ready to face the Church.
The Philippines is 80 percent Catholic.
The Church has been opposing the use of artificial family planning and pushing for natural ways.
Duterte will assume the presidency on June 30 after receiving landslide votes in the May 9 elections.
