MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Presumptive Philippine president-elect Rodrigo Duterte vowed to restore death penalty in his country, according to his speech on Monday.
In his press conference in Davao city in southern Philippines, Duterte said he wants to ask the next Congress to reinstate the death penalty which would be against drug pushers, rapists and kidnappers.
"What I would do is to urge Congress to restore the death penalty by hanging," he said, adding it is more humane and would not waste money for bullets.
Former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was against death penalty and repealed the capital law in 2006.
