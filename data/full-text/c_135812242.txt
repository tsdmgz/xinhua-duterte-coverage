 China urges U.S. to respect Philippines' independent foreign policy




BEIJING, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- China on Monday urged the United States to respect the Philippines' right to an independent foreign policy.
U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel told a news briefing in Washington last Thursday that he saw no evidence that President Rodrigo Duterte is backing away from the legal decision rendered by the tribunal on South China Sea, nor would he expect any Philippine leader to find it in their own best interests to do so.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said it is very interesting to see other countries repeatedly explain the position of the Philippines.
"To precisely understand the position of the Philippines, we should listen to what the Philippine leaders have said," he said at a daily press briefing.
President Duterte's recent remarks and actions have shown to the world what is best for the long-term and fundamental interests of Filipinos, he said.
Lu said that President Duterte has stated on several occasions that he does not like others taking it upon themselves to make decisions for him, for instance, explaining the Philippines' position on behalf of the Philippine government.
