 Indonesia says to respect legal processes in Philippines over Filipino woman jailed on drug case



JAKARTA, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has said it would respect the ongoing legal processes in the Philippines regarding the case of a Filipino woman jailed in Indonesia over drug charges.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Tuesday that he considers his Filipino counterpart Rodrigo Duterte has been firm on the eradication of drug abuse.
President Widodo said his government would respect the ongoing legal processes of a case involving Mary Jane Veloso, who is on death row in Indonesian jail for allegedly smuggling heroin into the country.
"We highly respect the legal processes in the Philippines. Now there is a process that is ongoing there," Widodo said at Tanjung Priok seaport.
Indonesia has delayed execution of Veloso since May following a request from the Philippines on the reason that Veloso has to undergo legal processes of a separate case in the Philippines.
Veloso was arrested at the main airport Adi Sutjipto in Yogyakarto province in April 2010 for bringing 2.6 kg heroin, and sentenced to death by the provincial court in October 2010.
