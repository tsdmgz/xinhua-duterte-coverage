 Philippines' latest elections lauded as "fastest ever" in terms of releasing results



MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The latest presidential elections in the Philippines held on May 9 have been lauded as the fastest ever in the country's history in churning out results, local media reported on Thursday.
Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte was proclaimed president-elect and congresswoman Leni Robredo vice president-elect on Monday, 21 days after the elections and within three days of canvassing.
For the 2010 presidential elections, it took 30 days to proclaim Benigno Aquino III as the winner.
Franklin Drilon, senate president, praised the electronic machines providers Comelec and Smartmatic for the speedy electronic count and canvassing, calling it "a job well done."
In the elections, winners at the local level were declared on the election night or the following day.
The public already knew who the winning candidates were for the national posts within 24 hours after the polls had closed.
"The success of the May elections doesn't stop at the speedy electronic count and higher voter turnout," Elie Moreno, general manager of Smartmatic Philippines.
The country also witnessed the fastest canvassing of votes for national positions, he added.
The May 9 elections in the Philippines saw the largest turnout since 1986 with 81 percent of the registered voters or over 44 million Filipinos casting their votes.
