 Duterte says he will not allow any country to interfere in Philippine internal affairs



MANILA, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Monday that the United States has no moral authority to give him a lecture on humans rights, warning he will not allow any country to interfere in Philippine internal affairs.
Duterte was reacting to a question that U.S. President Barack Obama might raise the issue of alleged extrajudicial killings in the Philippines during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and related summits this week in Vientiane, Laos.
"I do not want to pick a quarrel with Obama but certainly I would not appear to be beholden to anybody," Duterte told a news conference in Davao City in southern Philippines before leaving for Laos.
Duterte also slammed the U.S. for its human rights records in the past when it colonized the Philippines.
He said Obama must be careful of what issues that he raises at the summit.
Duterte is getting criticism for the mounting number of victims in killings of people allegedly involved in illicit drugs.
However, he said the campaign against illegal drugs will continue in spite of the criticism.
Philippine military and police continued to investigate a deadly blast that hit Duterte's hometown Davao City on Friday night. The attack claimed the lives of 14 people and injured almost 70 others.
Duterte vowed to remain firm in the resolve to combat terrorism.
