 Xi congratulates new Philippine president on inauguration


BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday sent a message to new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to congratulate him for his inauguration as the 16th head of state of the Republic of the Philippines.
In the congratulatory message, Xi said that he is willing to work with Duterte to push for improvement of relations between their two countries.
Hailing China and the Philippines as each other's neighbor that cannot be moved away, Xi said good-neighborliness and friendship is a historical inheritance for the thousands-year-long history of China-Philippine relations, which is also a right direction that must be insisted in the development of bilateral ties.
Duterte was sworn in as the 16th president of the Republic of the Philippines earlier Thursday.
