 Philippine gov't seizes 200 mln dollars worth of smuggled goods in less than 2 months



MANILA, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has confiscated 9.3 billion pesos (200 million U.S. dollars) worth of contraband since the new administration of President Rodrigo Duterte took office over a month ago, a senior government official said Monday.
Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon said the confiscated items ranged from drugs, red onions, sugars, and 10 high-powered firearms.
Apart from intensified campaign against smuggling, he said there is effort to make the Bureau of Customs "more transparent" to the public and to curb corruption.
"The setting up CCTV cameras in all the frontline offices of the Bureau of Customs have been ongoing," he said in a press conference in Malacanang, the presidential palace.
