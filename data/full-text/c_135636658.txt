 Philippine gov't, rebels sign cease-fire deal



OSLO, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and communist rebels signed a cease-fire agreement on Friday after week-long peace talks in Oslo to end Asia's longest-running insurgency, NTB news agency reported.
In a joint declaration, the government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, the umbrella organization of Marxist groups including the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed group, the New People's Army, said they have agreed on a cease-fire with no time constraints.
The declaration also marks the beginning of a new round of formal peace talks between them, said the report. The two parties agreed to meet again in Oslo on Oct. 8 to deal with some remaining tough questions, it added.
As Rodrigo Duterte became new Philippine president this June, his administration is keen to forge peace with the rebels.
The peace talks first began in 1986. Yet over the years, no tangible results were made. Norway has facilitated the peace process since 2001. The last formal round of the negotiations took place in 2011.
The rebels begun its insurgency in 1969 and reached its peak in 1987 when it boasted 26,000 armed guerillas.
However, the movement has since dwindled due to differences in strategy and tactics, as well as the arrest of many of its top leaders in the late 1980s. According to the Philippine military, the group now has around 4,000 members.
