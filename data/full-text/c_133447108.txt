 Philippine security forces on high alert for possible terror threat in Mindanao





MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Security forces of the Philippines have been ordered to verify information regarding the alleged security threat in the southern part of the country, a senior Philippine government official said on Sunday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said in an interview at the state-run radio station that the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) are now on alert and coordinating with each other to check possible terrorist threat.
It was Philippine President Benigno Aquino III who called up Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of the southern city of Davao to inform him about the possible terrorist attack in the city or other parts of Mindanao, such as the cities of Cagayan de Oro, Koronadal, and Kidapawan.
Quoting Ramon Zagala, chief public information officer of the AFP, Coloma said that the military and police units in Eastern Mindanao, including Davao, have always been on the alert even before the report of the president was announced.
The reported threat came as the Muslim Filipinos start their holy month of Ramadan on Sunday and the arrest recently of a high- ranking official of the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group, Khair Mundos, who was also on the terror watch list of the United States.
