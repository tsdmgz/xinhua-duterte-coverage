 Philippine gov't maintains no Filipinos recruited by ISIS





MANILA, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine military has denied reports that some Filipinos had been recruited and trained by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said on Monday.
The Philippine government left it to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to validate the report after Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte said some of his constituents had been recruited and are now being trained by ISIS, Lacierda said.
"There is none. We treat information only accurate if validated and so far there are no report nor names of Filipinos that are in the Middle East fighting for ISIS," Lacierda, quoting Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Zagala, military's public information office chief.
Earlier, former Philippine President Fidel Ramos, a retired military general, said that some 100 Filipinos were now training with the terrorist group.
The Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Movement (BIFM) also said earlier that they have formed an alliance with ISIS but denied sending men to Iraq and Syria.
Lacierda said AFP intelligence group had denied any information that Filipinos are training and fighting with the ISIS.
ISIS is said to have emanated from the Al Qaeda in Iraq.
