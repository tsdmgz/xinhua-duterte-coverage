 China says arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction over China's historical rights




BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday said the arbitral tribunal established at the request of the Philippines has no jurisdiction over China's historical rights in the South China Sea.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei made the remarks when asked to comment on the Philippines' claims in the case that China's historical rights do not comply with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
"Many articles of UNCLOS recognize the concepts of historic bays and historic ownership, showing respect for historical rights," Hong said at a regular news briefing.
Hong emphasized China's historical rights in the South China Sea are supported by historical and jurisprudential evidence and protected by international laws including UNCLOS.
The Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who was sworn into office last week, said on Tuesday ahead of the July 12 ruling that "if it's favorable to us, let's talk."
On 22 January 2013, the Philippines initiated the arbitration. China has repeatedly insisted that the tribunal has no jurisdiction over the case and it will neither accept nor recognize the ruling.
Hong urged the new Philippine government to discard the wrongdoing by the Aquino administration and return to solving disputes via negotiation.
