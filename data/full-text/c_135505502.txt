 U.S. diplomat reminds Philippines of alliance a day before arbitration ruling



MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Kristie Kenney, a State Department
counselor of the United States, on Monday reminded the Philippines
of the alliance between their two countries.

Kenney made the remarks a day before the Permanent Court of
Arbitration in The Hague is set to announce its final decision
Tuesday in territorial disputes between China and the
Philippines.

China has reiterated that it will neither accept nor recognize
any award in the South China Sea arbitration unilaterally initiated
by the Philippines.

"You know our commitment to the Philippines is iron-clad. We're
allies. We're friends. We're cultural partners. We have a treaty
alliance. You know we will obviously respect that treaty alliance
in every way," Kenney told ANC in an interview, reacting to a
question regarding the upcoming ruling.

Kenney, a former U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, arrived in
Manila last Saturday. She is the first high-level U.S. official to
meet Duterte administration representatives since the June 30
inauguration of the new government. Enditem
