 Duterte warns of looming IS problem in Philippines



MANILA, Aug. 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte warned Wednesday of the looming problem of terrorist Islamic State (IS) in the country.
Duterte made the warning after receiving information of the presence of "white skinned" Arab-looking people in southern Philippines.
"They are here as missionaries. They are not armed but they are into indoctrination," he said in a speech before members of the Philippine Army in southern province of Zamboanga del Sur.
"I see a looming problem. I think three to seven years from now, we can have an IS problem," he said.
He said before the minds of the Muslim brothers could be "contaminated" by the "IS disease," the government should act on this.
"There is something wrong in their minds about killing people...they burn people to death (with) no reason at all," Duterte added.
The previous administration had denied the presence of IS in the country, while the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group, which has been engaged in high profile kidnappings and killings, has pledged allegiance to the international terror group.
