 Philippines declares state of national emergency



MANILA, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte proclaimed on Monday the Philippines under a state of national emergency on account of lawless violence, a Malacanang presidential palace said in a statement.
Presidential Communications Office Assistant Secretary Kristian Ablan told reporters that "the proclamation technically took effect today and remains in force until lifted by the president."
He said Duterte "can call out the military as commander-in-chief by virtue of the constitution."
He said the proclamation commands the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippines National Police to undertake measures permitted by the constitution and laws.
