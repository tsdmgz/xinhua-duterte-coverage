 Duterte starts state visit to Brunei



BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte touched down in Brunei Sunday evening for his first state visit to the sultanate.
Duterte was welcomed by Brunei's Minister of Home Affairs Hj Awang Abu Bakar, Second Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Lim Jock Seng and other high-ranking government officials at the Brunei International Airport.
He then met with over 7,000 people of the Filipino community at Indoor Stadium in Bandar Seri Begawan.
During his visit, Duterte is scheduled to be accorded an official welcome on Monday at the Istana Nurul Iman palace before a bilateral meeting with the Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah.
Duterte had cancelled his visit to Brunei scheduled in early September following a deadly explosion in his hometown Davao City.
Brunei has strong defence relations with the Philippines and gives active support to the peace process in Mindanao, Philippines.
