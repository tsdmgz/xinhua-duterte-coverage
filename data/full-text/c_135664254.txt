 Philippines declares state of national emergency



MANILA, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte proclaimed on Monday a state of national emergency for the Philippines on account of lawless violence, a Malacanang presidential palace said in a statement.
Presidential Communications Office Assistant Secretary Kristian Ablan told reporters that "the proclamation technically took effect today and remains in force until lifted by the president."
He said Duterte "can call out the military as commander-in-chief by virtue of the constitution."
He said the proclamation commands the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippines National Police (PNP) to undertake measures permitted by the constitution and laws.
Ablan said the proclamation is mainly ordering both the AFP and the PNP to "suppress all forms of lawless violence in Mindanao and prevent lawless violence from spreading elsewhere across the country."
He said the state of national emergency on account of lawless violence gives "due regard to fundamental and civil political rights and has nothing to do with martial law or the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus."
"It's just a stepped-up campaign of the police and the military to ensure the safety of the general public," Ablan said.
