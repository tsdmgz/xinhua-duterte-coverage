 More than 2,800 killed in drug operations in Philippines



MANILA, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,800 people have been killed under the Philippine police's "Double Barrel" program, a campaign against illegal drugs, police said on Sunday.
From July 1, a day after President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office, to Sept. 4, a total of 1,011 drug suspects have been killed during the police operations, said police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Dionardo Carlos.
Meanwhile, 1,805 slain individuals' cases were under investigation, he said.
The police have also arrested 14,798 drug suspects, while 685,740 drug users and pushers surrendered to authorities.
Out of 111,572 police personnel who underwent random drug testing, 85 uniformed personnel and three non-uniformed personnel yielded positive result.
Duterte has declared an all-out war against illegal drugs. But the United Nations, the United States and other groups have raised concern over the increasing number of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.
