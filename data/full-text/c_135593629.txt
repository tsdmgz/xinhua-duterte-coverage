 Philippine gov't, Moro rebel group resume peace process



KUALA LUMPUR, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rejuvenated the peace process on Saturday by launching the implementing phase of the peace agreements.
The meeting held in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur is the first under President Rodrigo Duterte, two years after the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) between the Philippine government and MILF in 2014 facilitated by Malaysia.
Philippine presidential adviser on the peace process Jesus Dureza hailed the entering of implementation phase as another milestone in the peace process, stressing the commitment by the new Philippine administration to honor the past peace deals.
Murad Ebrahim, Chairman of MILF, said continuing the peace process remains the only reasonable and viable pathway that could bring progress, development and lasting peace to the Philippines.
Mohd Johari Baharom, Malaysia's deputy defence minister, said a successful peace process in the region would fend off treat posted by Islamic State (IS).
The implementation of the peace agreement with the MILF largely depends on its political track since the Bangsamoro Basic Law, the supposed implementing mechanism of the CAB, failed to pass in the previous Congress.
