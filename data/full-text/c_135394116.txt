MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Rodrigo Duterte and Maria Leonor Robredo have officially won the May 9 presidential and vice-presidential elections respectively, said the final tally of votes by the Philippine Congress Friday.
Sitting as the National Board of Canvassers, Congress said Duterte, 71, garnered a total of 16,601,997 votes or 6,623,822 votes ahead of his closest rival, administration candidate Manuel Roxas, who got 9,978,175 votes.
Congress finished canvassing all 166 certificates of canvass on its third day of official counting of votes, which started Wednesday.
"Finally victory has been achieved," Duterte's campaign spokesperson Peter Lavina said in a statement.
"The official results of 2016 presidential race with Duterte as winner may be anti-climactic, but we should not lose its historic significance," he added.
The official tally also showed that Robredo, 51, won as the country's vice president, garnering a total of 14,418,817, or 263,473 votes ahead of her closest rival Sen. Ferdinand Marcos, who got 14,155,344.
Congress is expected to officially proclaim both winners on Monday.
