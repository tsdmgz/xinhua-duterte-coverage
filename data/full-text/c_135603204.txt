 Philippine president assures travel of leftist rebel consultants for peace talks in Norway




MANILA, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered concerned government agencies to facilitate the travel of leftist rebel consultants who will participate in the formal resumption of talks later this month, a government peace panel official said Tuesday.
Government peace panel member Angela Librado-Trinidad said the president instructed the Bureau of Immigration and the Department of Foreign Affairs to assist the consultants of the National Democratic Front (NDF), the political wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines - New People's Army (CPP-NPA), who will be travelling to Oslo, Norway for the August 22 formal talks.
About 10 detained high-ranking leftist rebels, including couple Benito and Wilma Tiamzon, have been allowed to post bail to be able to join the peace negotiations in Norway, the third party facilitator in the peace process.
Duterte met Monday in Malacanang, the presidential palace, NDF lawyers, assuring that the released consultants will fly to Oslo, said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III, who heads the government panel negotiating with the NDF.
Jesus Dureza, presidential adviser on the peace process, will head the Philippine delegation during the opening ceremony.
"The President said, that while he was hurt by the sharp exchanges between him and CPP founding chair Jose Maria Sison who is based in The Netherlands, he gave assurances that he will walk the extra mile for peace," Dureza said.
The CPP, along with its armed wing - the New People's Army (NPA), is waging Asia's longest running insurgency.
The formal peace talks between the government and the leftist rebel group bogged down in 2011 during the Aquino administration.
