 Philippine foreign minister to attend ASEAN meeting for first time



MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. will join his other southeast Asian counterparts in their meetings in Laos from July 23 to 26, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Friday.
Yasay's attendance to the 49th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting (AMM) and Related Meetings will be his first ministerial meeting since he was appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte to the post.
Aside from AMM, Yasay will also attend the Ministerial Meetings of the ASEAN Plus Three, ASEAN Regional Forum, and East Asia Summit (EAS) including the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference with Dialogue Partners such as China, India, Canada, Australia, and the United States.
He will also attend the Meetings of the South East Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Commission, AMM Interface with the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission for Human Rights Representatives, and the Southwest Pacific Dialogue.
At the sidelines of the AMM, the DFA chief will have bilateral meetings with several counterparts to exchange views on matters affecting bilateral relations and common concerns on global and regional issues.
The AMM is the second regular Meeting of ASEAN Foreign Ministers this year under the Chairmanship of Lao PDR, after the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Retreat in February.
