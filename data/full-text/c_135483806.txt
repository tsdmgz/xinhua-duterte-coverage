 Philippine gov't condemns attack on commentator



MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on Saturday condemned an attack against a radio commentator in the southern city of Surigao.
Presidential Communications Operations Officer Martin Andanar vowed that justice will be served for Saturnino Estanio, and his 12-year-old son, who were both wounded in the ambush Thursday in Rizal village, Surigao City.
"We condemn this horrific act of violence. We find comfort in the fact that both father and son have survived to tell their story," he said in a statement.
Estanio of Radyo Mo Nationwide is known for his unrelenting tirades against the illegal drug trade and illegal gambling in Surigao City, he noted, adding "these are the same crimes being strongly pursued by the government of President Rodrigo Duterte."
Andanar said the country needs journalists who will fight the same crusade as the government.
"We need journalists who will not be cowed by threats in order to rid the nation of vices such as illegal drugs and illegal gambling," he said.
He assured the public that the Duterte administration stands by the side of good men.
"Justice will be served," he said.
