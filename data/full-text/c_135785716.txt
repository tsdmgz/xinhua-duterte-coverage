 Philippine president says to review military deal with U.S.



TOKYO, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday that he wanted to review a military agreement with the United States.
Duterte, on his final day in Japan, reiterated his stance that he intended to review the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement inked with the United States in 2014, which allows U.S. troops to maintain military bases in the Philippines and rotate its troops in and out.
"Maybe, I will review the EDCA and ask them (the U.S. military) one of these days to leave the country," he was quoted as saying.
Duterte also said the joint military exercises held between the Philippines and the U.S. have not been as beneficial to Manila as they should be.
During the president's three-day visit, Japan and the Philippines have agreed to enhance cooperation in a number of areas, including Japan providing the Philippines with infrastructural support.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would assist Duterte's war against drugs by helping out with addicts' rehabilitation.
Abe, after a meeting with Duterte a day earlier, said the Philippines will serve as ASEAN chair next year and Japan would provide its utmost support in this regard.
Duterte gave recognition to Japan as being an important dialogue partner for ASEAN.
