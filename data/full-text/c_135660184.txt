 Philippine gov't looking at other groups as responsible for deadly explosion in Davao



MANILA, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is not ruling out other possible groups besides Abu Sayyaf, which could be behind a deadly explosion in southern city of Davao, a senior government official said Sunday.
Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar said it could not be denied that the government has enemies in the drug lords.
"And we cannot deny it that these drug lords are also well funded, and they have their own nefarious interest to protect. So, it's part of the menu of suspects that we have," he said in an interview with a state-run radio.
President Rodrigo Duterte has declared a war against illegal drugs in which more than 2,000 suspected drug pushers and users have been killed.
The terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group had initially reportedly claimed responsibility over the bombing in a night market in Davao, the home city of Duterte, on Friday.
Andanar said in a scale of one to 100, the possibility that the explosion was perpetrated by drug syndicates was about 15 percent.
"Maybe 80 percent responsible in the attack were the terrorists or bandits, and 5 percent, the small breakaway groups," he said, adding that this was what the president has said during their meeting.
At least 14 people were killed and scores were injured during the explosion.
President Duterte has declared a state of lawlessness in the country, directing the military to help police in going after those responsible in the attack.
