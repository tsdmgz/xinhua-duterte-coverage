 Philippine president refuses to honor int'l agreement on carbon emissions



MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte
said on Monday his administration will not honor international
agreements which bind the country to limit its greenhouse
emissions.

Duterte believed that wealthy countries were "trying to stymie
us with an agreement," which provides certain greenhouse gas
emissions need to be maintained even by small nations, like the
Philippines.

The president made the remarks during a sendoff ceremony for
Filipino athletes who will compete in the Olympics Games in Rio de
Janeiro on Aug. 5-21.

He recalled that an ambassador, whom he did not name, reminded
him about the commitment made by the Philippines to lessen
emissions and the carbon footprints.

But he told the ambassador: "You who have reached your apex and
along the way spewed a lot of contaminants and emissions and went
ahead in destroying the climate, good for you."

"We are here, we have not reached the age of industrialization.
We are going into it. But you are trying to stymie us with an
agreement (telling us) that 'you will maintain the present
emission.' I said, 'that's stupid'," he stressed.

Duterte said he will not honor the agreement, whose signature
was not his but "somebody else's."

The Philippines under former President Benigno S. Aquino III
made a commitment last year that it will reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 70 percent by 2030 in solidarity with other nations
that will provide support in terms of finance, technology and
capacity building.

The new government has asserted that the Philippines can not
ditch coal as one of the energy sources for the country's
electricity requirements.

The Philippine government has just approved 29 more coal-fired
plants on top of the 17 already existing in the country.
