 Philippine president orders probe of police generals allegedly involved in drug trade



MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday ordered the National Police Commission to investigate five police generals who were allegedly "protectors of illegal drug syndicates."
"I am compelled by my sense of duty to tell you the police who contributed to the deterioration of law and order in this country," Duterte said in an impromptu speech at the 69th anniversary of the Philippine Air Force in Clark Freeport in Pampanga.
"At this time I order them being relieved from their assignments and report to the (Philippine National Police) chief Director General (Ronald de la Rosa)." Duterte said.
Duterte said: "We have long suspected (there are a lot of police officers involved in drugs). I am not ready yet with the other branches of government, agencies like Customs. I still have to validate; I have no raw information."
But on the five generals, Duterte said their names have come up "after so many validations."
The president has waged a war against criminals, especially drug lords.
Again, he urged policemen or officials not to engage in illegal drugs "because you will place yourself in the line of fire."
He has vowed time and again to kill those who are involved in the drug trade, saying these criminals are killing the youths and destroying the country.
The crackdown on illegal drugs has intensified since Duterte, who also offered a multi-million bounty for the capture or death of drug lords, won in the May elections.
He said the campaign against drugs will continue, hoping the campaign will be a success after six months.
Duterte has also ordered the military to help the police in the campaign. "It's going to be a bloody fight."
Dozens of alleged drug dealers have been killed or surrendered since Duterte gave the green light to the war against drug lords last May.
