 Philippine president to visit Vietnam from Sept. 28 to 29



MANILA, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is set to visit Vietnam from September 28 to 29, a senior government official said Sunday.
Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar said in an interview over a state-run radio station that aside from meeting his counterpart, Duterte will also meet with businessmen and the Filipino community in Vietnam during his trip.
He noted that Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez, who will accompany the president in his trip, has lined up programs related to trade and commerce.
While the president is in Vietnam, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea will again head the caretaker committee to oversee government operations, he said.
Duterte's trip to Vietnam will be his third overseas trip after Laos, where he attended a regional summit, and Indonesia early this month.
