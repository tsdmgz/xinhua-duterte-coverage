 Philippine president says to order review of defense pact with U.S.



MANILA, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Sunday that he would order a review of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), a defense pact that Washington and Manila signed in 2014.
Duterte made the remarks at a local festival in Bacolod City in the central Philippines.
He said, "Now, may I remind the Americans that it (EDCA) is an official document, but it was only signed by an aide, (former Defense Secretary Voltaire) Gazmin. It does not bear the signature of the president of the Republic of the Philippines, (Benigno) Aquino. Aquino did not sign it."
The Philippine president warned, "We will get out, and after a review of the document and if I find (out) that there is no signature, if you can not produce a signature bearing the permit to conduct war games ..."
