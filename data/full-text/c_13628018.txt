DAVAO CITY, Philippines, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and several homes were destroyed in a flash flood in a village in this southern Philippine city on Monday, police and disaster officials said on Tuesday. Two-year old Jericho Molina drowned when swift water current tore him off the shoulders of his mother as they tried to escape floodwaters in Camansi village, in Davao City's Toril district past 2 p.m., Superintendent Querubin Manalang, regional police spokesperson, said.
Nine homes were washed away by floodwaters following a three- hour heavy downpour which residents suspect was caused by a cloudburst in the city's upland villages, Manalang said, quoting the local city police.
Disaster officials said several persons, including the boy's mother, were slightly wounded and had to be treated at a local hospital in this city.
Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio was already ordered city social welfare officials to provide assistance to affected residents.Â
