 Philippine president does not approve extrajudicial killings: official



MANILA, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte does not condone extrajudicial killings, a senior government official said Tuesday.
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said Duterte also has ordered an investigation on the alleged salvaging of drug-related suspects.
"We would like to make a statement, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte has repeatedly expressed (that) he does not condone extrajudicial killings. But he also admitted that certain individuals may have been salvaged," he said in a news briefing in Malacanang, the presidential palace.
Abella was reacting on the statement from the United States State Department expressing concern on the series of killings in the Philippines of suspected drug dealers.
Abella said Duterte has ordered Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa to investigate the drug-related killings.
Some reports have said that over 400 people allegedly involved in illegal drugs have been executed since Duterte assumed office on June 30.
Abella also defended the president for publicly naming over 150 judges, local government officials, police and military personnel who were allegedly involved in the proliferation of illegal drugs.
He said Duterte was just taking the "position of parens patriae."
"As parent of nation, he is calling attention to clear and present danger of drugs. It's his moral obligation to make sure public is properly warned of the drug menace," he explained.
Over 600,000 drug users and pushers have already surrendered to the authorities.
Duterte has said that one hectare land in every military camp in the country would be utilized for the construction of rehabilitation centers for the drug dependents.
