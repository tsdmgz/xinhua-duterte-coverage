 Gov't holds "soft opening" of Chinese-backed drug rehabilitation center in N. Philippines



MANILA, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) made Tuesday the "soft opening" of a Chinese-funded rehabilitation center in the northern Philippine province of Nueva Ecija.
Health Secretary Paulyn Jean Ubial said at a news briefing in Malacanang, the presidential palace, that about 1,000 newly hired personnel conducted a dry run on how to manage the patients who will be referred to the facility located inside military's Fort Magsaysay in Laur, Nueva Ecija.
The operation of the facility could happen by mid-November, she said.
"Our opening of the mega drug treatment and rehabilitation center in Nueva Ecija is expected to be sometime November," she said, recalling that the construction of this rehabilitation center began soon after her visit to Beijing in September wherein a deed of donation with the donor, Huang Rulun, a Chinese businessman, was signed.
The newly built facility can accommodate up to 10,000 patients.
"Six weeks after the foundation was laid, the building structures gradually took shape and now, almost 50 percent of the facility has been constructed. The right wing of the building, which can accommodate almost 1,000 patients and offices are now ready to be furnished," Ubial said.
The DOH also plans to build rehabilitation centers in Visayas and Mindanao.
When President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office in June, he declared a war on illegal drugs. Since that time, about 790,000 drug addicts have surrendered to authorities.
