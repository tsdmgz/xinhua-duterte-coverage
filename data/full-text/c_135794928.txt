 China's jurisdiction over Huangyan Island unchanged: FM


BEIJING, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- China still exercises jurisdiction over Huangyan Island in the South China Sea, a spokesperson said Monday, following media reports that Chinese coast guard had recently allowed Philippine fishermen to fish nearby.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing that "the jurisdiction status will not change."
The China-Philippines relations have improved since President Rodrigo Duterte's visit earlier this month, Hua said.
"China has taken into account the situation and made some arrangements on issues of Duterte's interest for the good of the two countries' friendship," Hua added.
