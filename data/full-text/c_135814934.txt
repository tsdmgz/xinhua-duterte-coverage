 Philippine president dismayed over slow aid for Haiyan victims three years ago



MANILA, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte expressed Tuesday disappointment over the delay in the provision of shelters to the thousands of families displaced by typhoon Haiyan, locally named Yolanda, that devastated the country three years ago.
"I am not satisfied," Duterte said in a speech during his visit in the central city of Tacloban, the hardest hit area when Haiyan ravaged the country on November 8, 2013.
"It is this kind of service that I came here for. I'm really, I'm sorry I said, I do not want to offend anybody. I am not satisfied," he said.
Duterte ordered Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Mike Dino to accelerate the implementation of projects, particularly the housing units for the typhoon victims.
He said when he comes back in Tacloban in December, he expects that the displaced families have already transferred to their new homes.
Judy Taguiwalo, Department of Social Welfare and Development secretary (DSWD), said most of the funds, both from local and international donors, received for Haiyan survivors were allotted for Emergency Shelter Assistance (ESA).
"But even now thousands of Yolanda' survivors and their families have yet to receive a single peso. In the meantime, a shocking 62 percent of all DSWD core shelters have yet to be built," she said in a statement.
At the height of Haiyan, more than one million families were displaced, 6,300 individuals were killed and over 1,000 others were reported missing, according to the final report of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.
