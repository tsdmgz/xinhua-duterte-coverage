 China willing to cooperate in drug control with Philippines: FM




BEIJING, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- China supports Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign against drugs and is willing to strengthen cooperation with the Philippines in this area, a spokesperson said Friday.
Calling narcotics "an enemy of mankind," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said combating drug crimes is a responsibility shared by all countries.
He said the Chinese government was committed to eliminating drug-related crimes and the nation has been actively engaged in international cooperation in this regard.
"President Duterte will also be engaged in activities related to drug control during his state visit to China. China and the Philippines are keeping in close touch about this," Geng said.
The drug control departments in both countries have begun to discuss cooperation, with results likely to be released soon, the spokesperson added.
Duterte is waging a war against "narco-politics" in the Philippines, saying about four million Filipinos are into illegal drugs. The Philippine government plans to build more rehabilitation centers for drug addicts.
