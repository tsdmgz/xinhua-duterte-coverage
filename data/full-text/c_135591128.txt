 Duterte says he won't apologize for his remarks on U.S. envoy



MANILA, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Friday that he will not apologize to U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg, saying the envoy did not even bother to apologize when they saw each other many times in the Malacanang presidential palace.
"I will not apologize for anything. He did not even apologize to me. Why should I apologize to him?" Duterte told reporters in Jolo, Sulu where he was visiting.
"He started it. We met several times in Malacanang, and he never said 'hey buds, I'm sorry,' but it was an off-the-cuff statement or something like that," Duterte said.
He said he was really offended by the statements that Goldberg made during the campaign period.
"Why would make those statements during election time?" Duterte said. "Who will not be offended by those remarks during an election period?"
Goldberg criticized then presidential candidate Duterte for making light of the rape and killing of an Australian woman missionary during a jail riot in Davao City in 1989.
Last Saturday, Duterte slammed Goldberg, saying he was annoyed by the "gay ambassador."
"He meddled during the elections, giving a statement. You're not supposed to do that!" said Duterte.
The incident prompted the U.S. State Department to summon a Philippine diplomat in Washington to clarify Duterte's statement.
Goldberg is set to end his posting in the Philippines in October this year.
