 Philippines to raise allowances for athletes to Rio Olympics




MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday announced that he is more than doubling the allowances of the members of the Philippine delegation to Rio for the Summer Olympics as he urged them to do their best in each competition where they are representing the country.
Duterte, during a send-off ceremony for the Philippine delegation, said he is raising the allowances of the athletes, coaches and members of the secretariat from 1,000 U.S. dollars to 3,000 U.S. dollars and of the officials from 2,000 U.S. dollars to 5,000 U.S. dollars.
"One thousand (dollars), if I were you, I would not go there," Duterte joked before announcing that he is raising the allowances.
He urged the athletes to do their best regardless of the challenges that they will face in the Olympics, adding that the country is sending athletes to Rio where the country is likely to excel the most.
He told the athletes that they should just bear in mind that it is an honor to serve the country and that not everyone can do so.
Duterte said it is sad that the country does not have enough funds to finance the development of a person as an athlete nor to establish facilities and structure that can help the athletes improve in their disciplines, but he promised that he will try to do something to help uplift athletes in the country.
Philippine Sports Commission Chairman William Ramirez and Philippine Olympic Committee President Jose Cojuancgo Jr. both thanked Duterte for accommodating the delegation in Malacanang Presidential Palace and for showing his support for the team.
Cojuancgo said Duterte's support may be the inspiration that the Philippine team, especially the athletes, need to boost the morale.
The Philippines will take part in athletics and long jump, weightlifting, golf, table tennis, taekwondo, and swimming in the games which will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from August 5 to 21 this year.
