 Philippine gov't to resume formal talks with leftist rebels in August



MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is set to hold the formal peace talks with the leftist Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) next month, a senior government official said Tuesday.
Presidential adviser on the peace process Jesus Dureza said the talks will be held from Aug. 20 to 27 in Oslo, Norway.
"We look forward to engaging with our counterparts on the other side of the table," he said in a press conference in Malacanang, the presidential palace.
Prior to the formal resumption of the peace talks, he said President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered the concerned government agencies, such as the Department of Justice, to work for possible "temporary release" of some detained members of the CPP-NPA-NDF who will be participating in the negotiation.
He refused to name yet who will be the detained leftist rebels who might be granted temporary liberty.
During the talks, Dureza said they would discuss the activation of the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees, which provides for the safe conduct pass to some rebels; to affirm the previously signed agreements; and for the possible declaration of ceasefire.
The formal peace talks between the Philippine government and the leftist rebel group bogged down in 2011 under the administration of former President Benigno S. Aquino III.
The CPP-NPA-NDF has been waging war against the government for over four decades.
