 Philippine president congratulates Filipino weightlifter for bagging silver in Rio Olympics




MANILA, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte congratulated Monday the first female Filipino weightlifter who won silver medal in the Rio Olympic Games, ending the 20-year long medal drought for the country.
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the President is "honoured and proud" of Hidilyn Diaz.
"We extend our sincerest congratulations and celebrate the end of the medal drought," he said.
Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar said Diaz is the country's first Olympic medalist from war-torn southern Philippines.
Diaz hails from southern city of Zamboanga and took up weightlifting from a relative who taught her the sports.
"Hers is about overcoming shyness but for an inspired nation, her road to Rio is a journey of grit, patience and determination which ended a 20-year long medal drought for the Philippines," Andanar said.
The last time the Philippines won an Olympic medal was in 1996 when Mansueto Velasco bagged silver medal in boxing.
