 Pilippine president opens for UN probe on extrajudicial killings



MANILA, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Wednesday that his administration is open to be investigated by any group, including the United Nations, on the alleged extrajudicial killings involving drug suspects.
Duterte, in a speech before policemen, vowed that the government's fight against illegal drugs will continue and unrelenting "until we have destroyed the apparatus operating in the entire country."
"You know, it's very easy to complain. We in government and I myself who ordered the campaign against drugs take full sole responsibility for it and for those who are killed in a police operation and a firefight, we are willing to submit ourselves for an investigation before anybody and I would like also to just say why would the United Nations be easy to be swayed into interfering in the affairs of this republic?," he said.
The president said only about 1,000 drug suspects have been killed as compared to lots of innocent people being murdered elsewhere in the world without even seeing the slightest justice.
UN has raised concern over the reported extrajudicial killings under the Duterte administration.
Duterte warned that if the UN would come into the country, its representatives should not investigate "as if we are criminals."
"Do not do that. I would not receive you warmly in this country," he added.
He said the UN and other people should not attribute the killings to the drug syndicates in his government.
Duterte has promised to address crimes, including illegal drugs, in the first three to six months of his administration.
