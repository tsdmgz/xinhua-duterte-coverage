 Connection with U.S. reason for terrorist threat in S. Philippines: official



MANILA, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philipine government blamed Monday the United States for the continued terrorist threat in Mindanao.
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella made the statement after President Rodrigo Duterte said that American special forces in southern Philippines have to leave the place.
"The statement reflects PRRD's (Duterte) new direction towards coursing an independent foreign policy; he has made reference to the unrecognized, unrepented and un-atoned for massacre at Bud Dajo in Sulu by the Americans, hence our continued connection with West is the real reason for the 'Islamic' threat in Mindanao," he said.
The massacre at Bud Dajo which took place in 1906 was the issue raised by Duterte during the closed door meeting of the leaders in the East Asia Summit in Laos to emphasize the human rights violations committed by the Americans.
"The American silence on the matter lacks congruence with its 'moral' position, in the light of actions taken in the past by the Germans who confessed and made atonement for the Holocaust ... " Abella said.
The United States has raised concern over the reported extrajudicial killings in the Philippines amid the massive campaign against illegal drugs.
Abella stressed that Duterte is "on morally firm ground by breaking up walls that cover dark corners in US-RP relations."
Mindanao, specifically the island province of Sulu, is considered as the stronghold of the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group, which pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.
