MANILA, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Bureau of Customs has intercepted parcels containing illegal drugs from Germany, a senior government official said Wednesday.
According to Lieutenant Sherwin Andrada, Customs Anti-Illegal Drugs Task Force (CAIDTF) Executive Officer for Operations, the two parcels, which arrived recently from Recklinghausen, Germany, were seized after they were detected by a sniffer dog.
"The parcels were found to have more or less 2,000 pieces of ecstacy, valued at around 3 million pesos (64 thousand U.S. dollars)," he said.
The parcels, which weigh more or less 500 grams, were initially declared to contain vitamins upon entry in the country, he added.
The Filipino consignee could face violation of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, as amended, and Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.
President Rodrigo Duterte has declared an all-out war against illegal drugs.
