 Philippines ends 90-day election campaign period



MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The 90-day campaign period for the national candidates in the Philippines May 9 elections ended on Saturday.
Four of the five presidential bets are set to hold their "miting de avance," a gathering of their respective supporters where they would make their last appeal of support, on Saturday night in different cities in Metro Manila.
Vice President Jejomar Binay holds his "miting de avance" in his bailiwick in Makati City where he served as mayor for about two decades.
Administration presidential bet Manuel Roxas II will be in Quezon City, Senator Grace Poe at historic Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, and Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte in Luneta Park. Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago has no scheduled "miting de avance."
Starting midnight of Sunday until election day on Monday, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) has barred certain acts, such as further campaigning, and it will implement liquor ban.
But tourism establishments, which applied for exemption with the Comelec, could serve alcoholic drinks, particularly to the foreigners.
Under-secretary Manuel Quezon III of the Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office, in an interview over a state-run radio station, urged the 54 million Filipino voters to participate in Monday's elections.
Over 18,000 positions, including the president down to local officials, are at stake.
