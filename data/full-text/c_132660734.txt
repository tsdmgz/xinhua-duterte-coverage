 Leftist rebels free kidnapped soldier in S. Philippines





DAVAO CITY, Philippines, Aug. 25 (Xinhua)--- Leftist rebels released Saturday a soldier they have kidnapped early this month in Southern Philippines in an incident that insurgents claimed was preceded by a bomb attack that killed several soldiers.
Rodrigo Duterte, mayor of the regional center Davao City, helped in facilitating the release by the New People's Army of Private First Class Rodelio Rigonan in the hinterlands of Mindanao' s Compostela Valley province, said Captain Severino David, spokesperson of the military's Eastern Mindanao Command ( Eastmincom). "He is now being de-briefed at the Eastmincom headquarters (in Davao),"David said, even as he denied claims by the NPA that the military had prevented the freed soldier to meet with his wife.
Rubi del Mundo, NPA spokesperson in southern Mindanao region, said Rigonan's release was on"humanitarian grounds."
The military said the soldier, an electrician assigned at an army base in Maco town, also in Compostela Valley, was abducted by armed NPAs at his village in Langgam last Aug. 3 while helping a neighbor install a downed electrical connection. "He was unarmed and off-duty but the bandits still took him," said David, adding that the victim had also tried to stop NPA guerrillas who were attempting to plant an improvised bomb in the village when he was taken at gunpoint.
Earlier this week, the NPA had claimed 11 soldiers were either killed or wounded when they set off an improvised bomb last Aug. 5. The military denied the NPA's casualties claim.
The 4,000-strong NPA, armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, has been fighting a leftist insurgency in 60 Philippine provinces since 1969.
