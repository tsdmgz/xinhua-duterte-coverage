 China welcomes Duterte's readiness for talks



BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's willingness to begin talks with Beijing on disputes in the South China Sea, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Friday.
Duterte said on Thursday that he was asking former President Fidel Ramos to go to China to open bilateral talks, after a ruling by a tribunal on the South China Sea issue two days ago.
"The door to settling the issue through dialogue and negotiation has never been closed," said spokesperson Lu Kang at a daily press briefing.
Commenting on the arbitration filed by the previous Philippines government, Lu restated China's position that it will not recognize and accept any proposition and action based on the award.
He expressed the belief that bilateral ties will be bright if the two sides insist to solve their differences through dialogue and consultation.
"It is China's hope that the two countries will return to the consensus of settling related issue through dialogue and consultation, and work together to improve bilateral relations," Lu said.
