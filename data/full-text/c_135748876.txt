 Duterte: Don't prepare for any joint war games with U.S. next year



MANILA, Oct 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Wednesday that he has instructed his defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, not to make preparations for any joint war games with the U.S. next year.
"I do not want it anymore," Duterte said in a speech at the Philippine coast guard headquarters in Manila.
"'Do not prepare' I told Defense Secretary Lorenazana. 'Do not make preparations for next year (anymore)'," he said.
"I insist that we realigned. That there will be no more exercises next year," Duterte said.
Duterte reiterated his plan to chart an independent foreign policy.
However, Duterte said that the Philippines will not break it alliances with the U.S., a treaty ally.
"But we need not really break or abrogate existing treaties because they say that it would provide is with the umbrella," he said, apparently referring to security umbrella.
Duterte said he was fed up with U.S. criticisms over his anti-drug campaign that resulted in the death of more than 3,000 suspected drug users and pushers.
Duterte has earlier said that he wants to scrap the annual joint exercises with U.S. military during his term, saying it does not benefit the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
He also barred the Philippine military from taking part in joint patrols with the U.S. in the disputed South China Sea, saying Beijing scoffed at the activities.
He also ordered all the more than 100 U.S. soldiers helping the Philippine military in the fight against terror to get out of Mindanao.
The U.S. and the Philippines hold three major joint war games plus 28 small-scale exercises every year to increase interoperability.
