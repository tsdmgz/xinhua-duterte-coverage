 Philippine illegal drugs haul in first month of Duterte gov't amounts to 2.6 bln pesos



MANILA, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has significantly increased its illegal drugs' seizure, which amounted to 2.594 billion pesos (55 million U.S. dollars) during the first month of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, a senior government official said Thursday.
From July 1 to 31, the anti-narcotics agencies led by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) conducted 123 anti-drug operations, resulting in the arrest of 215 drug personalities and the seizure of dangerous drugs and controlled precursors and essential chemicals (CPECs).
"The 2.5 billion pesos seizure of illegal drugs was achieved only in a month's time, compared to the total estimated value of 2.86 billion pesos confiscated the entire year of 2015,"said PDEA Director General Isidro S. Lapena.
Out of the seized drug evidence, 180 kilograms of methamphetamine hydrochloride, or shabu, with an estimated market value of 900 million pesos, were dug up in northern province of Cagayan.
For the period, two clandestine laboratories used in the manufacture of shabu, and one storage facility were dismantled, Lapena said.
"The timeline has been set and the targets have been identified. PDEA and other partner agencies are working diligently to address the self-imposed obligations made by President Duterte to the Filipino people,"the PDEA chief said.
Duterte has promised to address crime, including illegal drugs, within the first three to six months of his administration.
Hundreds of thousands of suspected drug users and pushers have already surrendered to authorities. The government is now finding ways on how these drug dependents could be rehabilitated.
