 Philippine new president continues to enjoy "excellent" approval rating



MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte continues to enjoy "excellent" approval rating, an independent Social Weather Station survey said Wednesday.
The SWS survey, published by BusinessWorld on Wednesday, said about 84 percent of those 1,200 respondents showed "much trust" in Duterte.
The survey was conducted June 24 and 27, a few days before Duterte took his oath of office as the country's 16th president. Only five percent said they had "little trust" with Duterte and 11 percent said they were undecided.
"The mandate is clear and unequivocal. It is a mandate for change," said Communications Secretary Martin Andanar. "This is a positive sign. It is very encouraging to know that people trust the president."
"What's more heartwarming to the president is the fact that the young people of this country entrust their future to his able leadership," adding that the survey showed that Duterte got "excellent" public trust rating among the 18-24 years old.
Andanar said the people's expectations are high and the Duterte administration will work "double time" in improving the lives of the Filipinos. "Our people deserve no less," he said.
