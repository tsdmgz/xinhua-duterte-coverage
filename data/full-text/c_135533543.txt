 Duterte eyes Alunan as special envoy to China if Ramos turns down post



MANILA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte
said Friday he is eyeing former Interior and Local Government
Secretary Rafael Alunan as special envoy to China in the event that
former president Fidel Ramos turns down his earlier offer to head
the team that will kickstart bilateral talks with Beijing.

"If President Ramos tells me that he is not available then I'll
appoint Alunan. He's good. He is a colonel in the reserved force.
He knows his business," Duterte said in a speech before Army troops
in Maguindanao Province in the southern Philippines.

Alunan served as interior secretary under Ramos. He ran for
senator last May but lost.

On July 14, Duterte bared his plan to send Ramos to Beijing.
However Ramos has allegedly expressed reluctance to accept the role
citing health reasons and possible conflict of schedules.

willingness to mend relations between the Philippines and China,
which have been strained over disputes in the South China Sea in
recent years. Enditem
