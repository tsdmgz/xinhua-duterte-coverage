 Philippine military shifts weapons tack to internal security: incoming military chief



MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the Philippines will focus on getting more modern helicopters and naval fast craft under its modernization program so that it can address internal security threats, local media reports on Friday.
The Standard, the country's daily English newspaper, quoted the incoming Philippine military chief-of-staff Ricardo Visaya, who said the weapons would be useful in dealing with the country's ongoing campaign against the Abu Sayyaf Group and New People's Army Threats.
Visaya said the incoming president Rodrigo Duterte wants to change the country's public security situation and make the whole country as safe as southern city of Davao, where he has been the mayor for most of the past two decades.
The military will prioritize acquisition of helicopters with night-fighting capabilities, said Visaya.
Lack of night-capable helicopters and fast craft, according to Visaya, hampered the military response when the Abu Sayyaf Group kidnapped four people in September last year. Two victims were beheaded in April and June, respectively.
Visaya also clarified that acquisition of equipment to beef up external defense capabilities will continue under the same modernization program. However, it will give way to acquisition of items needed for internal security operations.
