 Executive secretary as caretaker head of Philippines while president abroad: Duterte



MANILA, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Duterte tapped Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea as head of a caretaker committee that would oversee the day-to-day operations of government while he takes a weeklong visit to Laos and Indonesia on Monday.
The president is set to leave late Monday afternoon for Laos to attend the 28th and 29th ASEAN summits and related summits on Sept. 6-8. He will visit Indonesia on Sept. 8-9 before he returns to Manila.
Duterte, who had been staying in Davao City since last week, will fly to Laos from Davao.
He will head a 30-man delegation which includes Senator Alan Peter Cayetano who is accompanying Duterte as chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Also joining the president are Communications Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella.
He cancelled a planned visit to Brunei following a bombing attack in Davao City on Friday which left 14 people dead.
