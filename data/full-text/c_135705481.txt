 Philippine president uses obscene word against EU for criticizing his anti-drug campaign



MANILA, Sep. 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte went all out against the European Union, warning the bloc in literally the harshest language possible to stop pointing fingers at his country's latest anti-drug campaign.
In a televised speech delivered at his home city of Davao late Tuesday, Duterte used the F word against the EU, and to drive his point home he then raised his middle finger before his audience.
The European Parliament had previously condemned Manila for abusing human rights in its bid to root out the rampant drug trade, a major initiative Duterte has spearheaded since taking office in June.
"But who did I kill? Assuming it to be true, 1,700, who are they? Criminals. You call that genocide," Duterte said.
European colonial powers, which have killed thousands of people in their colonies, are "hypocrites," he said.
This is not the first time the 71-year-old leader vented his anger toward the West. Earlier this month, he attacked U.S. President Barack Obama for meddling with his country's domestic politics, but later said it was not his intention to insult Obama.
