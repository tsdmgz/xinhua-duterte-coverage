 Philippine president leaves for ASEAN summit, seeking int'l cooperation to counter terrorism



MANILA, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte left here on Monday for Laos, where he will seek better efforts to address terrorism and extreme violence at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit.
Duterte will be joining his counterparts in the 28th and 29th ASEAN Summit and Related Summits, his first international gathering since he assumed office on June 30.
"Recent events have shown that there are elements out there to sow terror and wreak havoc in our society. We remain firm in our resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations," he said in his departure speech in the southern city of Davao, which was rocked by an explosion Friday night, leaving 14 people dead and 70 others injured.
"I will use the opportunity for meeting with other ASEAN leaders and ASEAN dialogue partners to seek better support to regional efforts to address terrorism and violent extremism," he said.
The president said terrorism and extremism is a global concern and the Philippines will do its part as a member of the international community and work with partners to address this issue.
The Abu Sayyaf group, which has been a target of intensified military operations in the southern province of Sulu, reportedly claimed responsibility in the Davao attack.
But the government is also looking into other groups, such as the drug syndicates, which have been targeted by the administration's all-out war against illegal drugs.
Dutyerte cancelled his planned trip to Brunei due to the Davao explosion.
