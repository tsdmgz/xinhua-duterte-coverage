 Philippine official says Manila "truly free" to pursue national interests



MANILA, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is "now truly free to follow what our national interest dictates," a senior Philippine official has said.
Martin Andanar, the communications secretary, made the comments in an opinion piece published Monday in the Philippine daily Inquirer.
He said Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has the valid reasons to be unhappy with the way the country's foreign policy was ultimately shaped by certain foreign country.
The president wants "separation," which should work finely if the historical context which he wrestles with is considered as he strives to redefine the country's international ties, Andanar said.
Having thus done the work, "we are now truly free to renew the ancient ties we had with our neighbors," he said, adding that the Philippines can freely associate with other nations.
"This is what a truly independent foreign policy should be," Andanar stressed, noting that it is certainly not about burning bridges with old friends.
The country's leader "understands that fully - and boldly," he said.
