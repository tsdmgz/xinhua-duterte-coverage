 1st LD: Ramos accepts Duterte's offer to be special envoy to China: media



MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine President Fidel
Ramos told reporters on Saturday evening in Davao that he accepted
the offer of President Rodrigo Duterte to be special envoy to
China, local media reported on Saturday.

Ramos made the announcement after meeting with Duterte for two
hours in Davao City in southern Philippines, according to the
ABS-CBN breaking news report.

The media quoted Ramos as saying that he has consulted his
doctors who gave him the go-signal to perform the job.

On July 14, Duterte bared his plan to send Ramos to Beijing to
help kickstart bilateral talks over strained relations between the
two countries.

Tensions between China and the Philippines heightened in recent
years over territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

In 2013, the philippine government under former President
Benegno Aquino unilaterally initiated an arbitration case against
China over the dispute to a court of arbitration in The Hague.

The court issued its ruling on the dispute on July 12, which
China has rejected as illegal.

Malacanang presidential palace has yet to officially announce
details of the meeting between Ramos and Duterte.

Ramos earlier expressed reluctance to accept the role citing
health reasons and possible conflict of schedules. Enditem
