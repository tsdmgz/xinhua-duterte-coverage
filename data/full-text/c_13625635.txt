Leftist rebels release kidnapped ailing soldier in S Philippines







DAVAO CITY, Philippines, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- Leftist rebels on Sunday freed a sick soldier they kidnapped on Nov. 16, military officials said.
Corporal Daiem Hadjaie was released by his New People's Army ( NPA) captors to local officials led by Davao city vice mayor Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday in the hinterlands of the gold-rich Compostela Valley, according to Lieutenant Colonel Gilbert Saret, the soldier's battalion commander.
"Yes, he (Hadjaie) is already released and is undergoing medical examination at the Panacan regional military hospital in Davao City," said Lieutenant Colonel Medel Aguilar, an army regional spokesperson.
Hadjaie's release came a day after the local NPA leadership gave assurance to his family about his health and called on the military to abort combat operations in attempts to rescue him.
The victim, a former Moro National Liberation Front rebel who was integrated into the Philippine army as part of a peace deal between the government and the former Moro rebel group, was snatched at an NPA checkpoint at a village in Monkayo town on his way to a medical checkup at the regional military hospital during the Eid al-Adha celebration 12 days ago.
The NPA, armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, has been waging a guerrilla campaign in the countryside for four decades. Military estimates the NPA strength at more than 4,000 fighters scattered in more than 60 guerrilla fronts throughout the country.
Peace talks between the government and the leftists bogged down after the United States included the NPA and its parent body as foreign terrorist organizations in 2002.
