 Philippines' Duterte questions relevance of military alliances



MANILA, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday wondered aloud whether military alliances are still relevant in this day and age, adding he has no plan of scrapping military alliances.
In a speech during an oath-taking ceremony at the Malacanang presidential palace, Duterte said, "I do not mean to cancel or abrogate the military alliances."
The Philippines has bilateral security alliance with the U.S. bound by the Mutual Defense Treaty that Washington and Manila signed in 1951.
The Philippines also regularly conducted joint war games with U.S. troops. But Duterte said the training only benefits the Americans and not the Philippine troops.
"Let us go for alliances that would contribute to the health, to the education if there is a world out there waiting for our children. Otherwise we have to protect them," he said.
Duterte, who assumed the presidency on June 30, said he wants to terminate military exercises with the U.S. military during his term and prohibit the Philippine military from joining in joint patrols in the South China Sea.
Last Sept. 28 he said PHIBLEX 33, the U.S.-Philippine joint military exercise, could be the last during his six-year term in office.
On Tuesday, the U.S. and Philippine marines wrapped up their amphibious landing exercises and live-fire training in the Philippines, a day ahead of the scheduled closing.
