BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China hopes the Philippines' new government can return to dialogue with China to resolve the South China Sea disputes, a spokesperson said Wednesday.
The comment came after the Philippines' incoming foreign minister Perfecto Yasay said that bilateral talks between the Philippines and China could help untangle the disputes in the South China Sea, adding "there is no other way but to go bilateral."
"China welcomes Mr. Yasay's remarks," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a regular news briefing.
Successive leaders of the two countries have agreed in their meetings and bilateral political documents that the South China Sea disputes should be resolved peacefully through direct negotiations, Hua said, adding that it was also outlined in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC).
Thanks to the above-mentioned consensus, China and the Philippines have managed the South China Sea disputes through dialogue and consultation for a long time, Hua said.
"We hope the Philippine's new government can honor their commitments and return to dialogue with China to properly handle the disputes so as to contribute to the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations," the spokesperson added.
The Philippines' incoming president Rodrigo Duterte has said that he wanted to cultivate friendly relations with China, and confirmed that he was open to direct talks over the row in the South China Sea, which had damaged bilateral relations.
