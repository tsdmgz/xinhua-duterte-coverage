 21 Abu Sayyaf members killed in S. Philippine operations



MANILA, Aug. 28 (Xinhua) -- Death toll from military operations in southern Philippine province of Sulu against the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group has increased to 21, military said Sunday.
Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff General Ricardo Visaya said the military will continue vigorously in pursuing the terrorist group.
"We have this one chance to annihilate this menace to society that claims links with ISIS," he said.
President Rodrigo Duterte, the commander-in-chief, has ordered the military to destroy the bandits, particularly after the beheading early this week of a Filipino hostage after his family failed to pay them ransom.
Brigadier General Restituto Padilla Jr., AFP spokesperson, said aside from the 21 confirmed slain Abu Sayyaf members, there were also wounded bandits.
On the government side, he said 17 soldiers were wounded by shrapnel.
"Only seven were evacuated to the nearby Camp Navarro Station Hospital where they are in stable condition; the rest opted to remain in the frontline to press on the attack," he said.
The Abu Sayyaf bandits are still holding several foreign and local hostages in southern Philippines.
