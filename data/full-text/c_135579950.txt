 Japan FM to call on Duterte in Davao



MANILA, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida will call on Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Davao City on Thursday, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday.
The foreign department said in a statement that Kishida will undertake an official visit to the Philippines from Aug. 10 to 12.
The statement did not say about the issues that Duterte and Kishida will discuss during their meeting.
"The Philippines will be Kishida's first official visit following his reappointment to the position of foreign minister of Japan after a cabinet reshuffle on Aug. 3. The Philippines was also the first country he visited after his first appointment as Japan's foreign minister in 2012," the statement read.
In 2015, the Philippine and Japan signed the joint declaration, a Strengthened Strategic Partnership for Advancing the Shared Principles and Goals of Peace, Security, and Growth in the Region and Beyond.
Last month, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also paid a courtesy call on Duterte at the Malacanang presidential palace in Manila.
