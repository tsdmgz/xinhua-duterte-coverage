 1st LD: Philippine Congress proclaims Duterte as presidential winner



MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Congress proclaimed Rodrigo Duterte as presidential winner and Leni Robredo as vice presidential winner on Monday.
Duterte and Robredo won the highest number of votes in the May 9 elections.
President-elect Duterte, however, was not present at the proclamation ceremony by the joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives in Quezon City, Metro Manila.
Only Robredo, who ran under the ruling Liberal Party, was present.
Duterte beat his four rivals in the presidential election with overwhelming votes of 16,601,997. Duterte had a lead of almost 7 million votes over second-placer Manuel Roxas, the candidate endorsed by Aquino, in the hotly contested election.
Robredo, on the other hand, defeated five other vice presidential bets with overall votes of 14,418,817. Her closest rival, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., received 14,155,344 votes.
Marcos camp has been questioning the alleged irregularities that took place in the elections, noting that the "controversial results" in the vice presidential race "must be looked into."
Duterte, 71, and Robredo, 51, will assume their posts on June 30 for a six-year term.
