 Philippine president says to ratify Paris climate change agreement



MANILA, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Monday that he would ratify the climate change deal reached in Paris in 2015.
Duterte changed his mind after almost all of his Cabinet officials agreed to honor the Paris Agreement.
"By the way, after so much debate, I will sign the climate change (deal)," he said at an event in Malacanang.
Personally, Duterte said, he was not in favor to ratify the agreement because it would bind the Philippines to follow the deal to the detriment of its development.
"(But) because it's a Cabinet decision, I'll go along with it and sign it. As I have promised you, I will not solve this problem alone," he said.
The Philippine government, during the previous administration, signed the Paris Agreement along with nearly 200 countries.
Manila has committed to contributing its fair share to the global action consistent with the Climate Vulnerable Forum's Manila-Paris Declaration.
