 Duterte slams EU for voicing concern over drug-related killings in Philippines



MANILA, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday slammed the European Union for voicing concern over the increasing number of drug-related killings in the Philippines.
"I read the condemnation of the EU against me. I will tell them, 'fuck you.' You're doing it in atonement for your sins," Duterte said in a speech in Davao City, his hometown in the southern Philippines.
Duterte called the EU hypocrites, citing the alleged killings committed by France and Great Britain against the Arabs.
The EU has called on the Philippine government to "put an end to the current wave of extrajudicial executions and killings" of people who are allegedly hooked on illicit drugs.
The EU parliament has also directed the EU delegation in the Philippines and the embassies of 28 European countries in the Philippines to monitor rights abuses following Duterte's declaration of a "state of national emergency on account of lawlessness" on Sept. 3.
More than 3,000 alleged drug users and pushers have been killed since Duterte took office on June 30, according to police and media records.
Duterte has vowed to eradicate drug-related criminality in six months. But last Sunday he said he needs another six month more, given the severity of the drug problem besetting the country.
