 Philippines president orders to arrest foreigners allegedly engaged in IS indoctrination



MANILA, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered the law enforcers to arrest the Caucasian-looking people who were allegedly involved in indoctrinating Filipinos in southern Philippines on the teachings of the terrorist Islamic State.
Duterte told reporters Thursday night in southern Philippine city of Davao that he asked the military to check the information regarding the presence of these unarmed foreigners who are in the "guise of educating" the people in Mindanao.
"I told the military to validate it and arrest all of them and we will deport them for acts inimical (to national security)," he said.
Meanwhile, Duterte, during his visit Friday in a military camp in southern province of Sulu, told the soldiers to crush the Abu Sayyaf Group.
"Those who want to destroy us, then you have to destroy," he said.
The Abu Sayyaf Group, which has been engaged in high profile kidnappings and killings, has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.
