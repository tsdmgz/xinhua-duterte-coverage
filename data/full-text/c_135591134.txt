 Detained leftist rebel leaders allowed to join talks with Philippine gov't in Norway



MANILA, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine court granted bail to detained leftist rebel leaders on Friday, paving the way for them to participate in the peace talks with the Philippine government later this month.
Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza welcomed the Manila Regional Trial Court's ruling to enable Benito and Wilma Tiamzon to attend the peace negotiations on Aug. 20-27 in Oslo, Norway, the third party facilitator in the peace talks.
"The couple occupies a strategic leadership role in the talks as high ranking leaders of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP)," he said.
Dureza said the participation of the Tiamzons in the peace talks "ensures an inclusive outcome, hopefully to end conflict and bring about comprehensive and sustainable peace throughout the land" as envisioned by President Rodrigo Duterte.
The Tiamzon couple were arrested in central province of Cebu in March 2014 for murder, multiple murder, and frustrated murder charges.
Benito is the chairman of the CPP-New People's Army, while his wife Wilma is the secretary-general.
Two other detained consultants of the CPP-NPA-National Democratic Front were also allowed to post bail.
The NPA, with an estimated membership of 4,000, has been waging war against the government for over four decades.
