 Philippines committed to restoring defense relations with China: defense secretary




BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is committed to restoring defense relations with China, said Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Friday.
Lorenzana, who was in Beijing with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, made the remarks when he met his Chinese counterpart Chang Wanquan in Beijing.
Hailing the historic importance of Duterte's visit, Chang said it is in both countries' fundamental interests and good for regional peace and stability that China and the Philippines develop friendly ties.
The two militaries must take responsibility to implement the consensus reached by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Duterte during the visit, steer away distractions, manage differences, accumulate mutual trust and promote cooperation to contribute to bilateral ties, said Chang.
Lorenzana said President Duterte's visit aims to develop closer relations with China, adding that his country is willing to forge ahead in bilateral defense cooperation.
Duterte left Beijing late Friday afternoon, ending his four-day state visit to China. China is the first country he has visited outside ASEAN, since taking office in June.
