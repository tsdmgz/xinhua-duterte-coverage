     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The South China Sea arbitration unilaterally initiated by former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III has not only soured China-Philippines ties, but also undermined international rule of law and regional stability.</text:p><text:p>The arbitration was a bad idea from the beginning for one simple reason: it is detrimental to the interests of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that groups 10 member states, including the Philippines.</text:p><text:p>Firstly, the integrity of ASEAN is at stake. The United States, a close ally of the Philippines, has long interfered in the region and is using the arbitration to widen divisions and undermine mutual trust. ASEAN members have differed on the South China Sea issue, the arbitration, as well as external intervention by non-regional countries.</text:p><text:p>Secondly, the arbitration compromises existing ASEAN rules of conduct. For more than half a century, ASEAN member states have emphasized a spirit of equality, consensus and cooperation.</text:p><text:p>For example, the dual-track approach, originally thought up by ASEAN and supported by China, advocates that disputes should be resolved peacefully through negotiations between parties directly concerned. It further calls on China and ASEAN to work together to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.</text:p><text:p>The dual-track approach is the most pragmatic way to manage maritime and territorial disputes in the South China Sea. It is also in full compliance with the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), signed by China and all ASEAN members in 2002.</text:p><text:p>However, the unilateral arbitration against China completely disregards the DOC, denies the double-track approach and ignores ASEAN&apos;s many past achievements in using negotiation as a tool to resolving disputes.</text:p><text:p>Thirdly, regional security is at risk. The frequent visits by aircraft and warships from countries outside the region are a deep concern for ASEAN and could spark an arms race. Some external countries having a hidden agenda are repeatedly muddying the waters, leaving regional countries to bear the brunt of any consequent instability.</text:p><text:p>More importantly, arbitration isn&apos;t a panacea to solving disputes. Instead, it more likely creates more disputes and stokes regional tensions, doing harm to the fundamental interests of peoples in the region.</text:p><text:p>With regard to the so-called arbitration, China has repeated its stance of non-acceptance of third-party dispute settlements or any imposed solution.</text:p><text:p>The disputes between China and the Philippines can only be solved via bilateral negotiations on the basis of fully respecting historical facts and in line with international laws.</text:p><text:p>Since winning election, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made a string of overtures on Philippines-China relations, with his spokesperson Ernesto Abella having said that Duterte wanted a &quot;conversation&quot; with China on the South China Sea to work out a &quot;win-win relationship&quot; with the country.</text:p><text:p>If Duterte is serious about solving the South China Sea issue properly and about bringing the China-Philippines ties back on track, it is time for him to act as a responsible player and make the right choice to eliminate the advance effects caused by the arbitration farce as soon as possible. </text:p><text:p/>

     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>by Alessandra Cardone</text:p><text:p>ROME, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming arbitration on the South China Sea dispute by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague is likely to stir more tensions in the region, said an Italian expert.</text:p><text:p>&quot;I reckon the judgement of the court will not help the dialogue between the two parties involved, China and the Philippines, but rather worsen the crisis,&quot; Domenico Losurdo, a famous Italian historical philosopher and professor at the University of Urbino, told Xinhua in a recent interview.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Bilateral negotiations would be instead the most effective path to solve the dispute,&quot; he added.</text:p><text:p>The two countries had already reached an agreement on settling their South China Sea disputes through bilateral negotiations in the mid-1990s, and again in the early 2000.</text:p><text:p>Yet, the Philippines unilaterally decided to bring the issue before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2013, seeking arbitration over the case.</text:p><text:p>&quot;By unilaterally filing the case against Beijing at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Philippines clearly contradicted its commitment to the ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), which it had previously signed,&quot; the expert said.</text:p><text:p>The DOC expressed the desire to enhance favorable conditions for a peaceful and durable solution of differences and disputes through friendly negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned.</text:p><text:p>&quot;That Agreement also appealed for the parties to exercise self-restraint, and avoid taking actions that could complicate or escalate the disputes,&quot; Losurdo stressed.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The unilateral initiative by the Philippine has exactly resulted in such an escalation, the outcome of which is now difficult to forecast,&quot; added the expert.</text:p><text:p>Losurdo, a professor emeritus of Philosophy and former Dean of the Science of Education Faculty at the University of Urbino, said the Philippines&apos; step made more sense in a broader, geopolitical perspective.</text:p><text:p>It was necessary to consider the U.S. strategic &quot;pivot to Asia&quot; or rebalancing launched by U.S. President Barack Obama&apos;s administration, which marked a shift in American foreign policy from the Middle East and Mediterranean area to the Asian Pacific region.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It is within this context that the Philippines decided to drop negotiations (with China) in 2013, and resort to arbitration before the Permanent Court with the help of U.S. legal consultants,&quot; said Losurdo.</text:p><text:p>According to the expert, the whole issue would serve U.S. interests in terms of preserving its hegemony in the Asian Pacific region, confining China as a &quot;land power&quot; only, and making a U.S. naval blockade easier during a possible crisis.</text:p><text:p>China asserts the international tribunal has no authority over such a case, which is essentially about territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation, and made clear it will not accept the arbitration.</text:p><text:p>&quot;This is also a widely shared view among international jurists. And the Permanent Court of Arbitration itself seems to indirectly confirm this line, by assessing the claim as a matter of interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),&quot; Losurdo said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Yet, the dispute is indeed about the sovereignty of the South China Sea islands,&quot; the expert added.</text:p><text:p>Furthermore, China excluded maritime delimitation from compulsory arbitration in a declaration made in 2006, in accordance with Article 298 of UNCLOS concerning the optional exceptions to the applicability of the U.N. Convention.</text:p><text:p>As Chinese authorities recently called again on Manila to abandon the arbitration application and return to bilateral negotiations, Losurdo suggested a positive development might come with the newly elected president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The new president seems more open to dialogue. Somehow, bilateral negotiations might still resurface as the main pathway to solve this dispute,&quot; he told Xinhua. </text:p><text:p/>

Aquino III initiated the arbitration in 2013. Dialogues were disrupted after the tribunal claimed jurisdiction two years later.</text:p><text:p>Since talks stalled, tensions have mounted. U.S. warships and planes have frequented the South China Sea under the pretext of safeguarding &quot;freedom of navigation and overflight.&quot;</text:p><text:p>Meanwhile, Washington and Manila held a slew of joint military drills near the waters of the South China Sea. The scale of their war games kept increasing while the weapons used by their servicemen became increasingly sophisticated.</text:p><text:p>In April, thousands of U.S., Philippine and Australian troops attended an 11-day exercise in the South China Sea region, which deployed the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, capable of firing waves of rockets and missiles from a long range with great accuracy.</text:p><text:p>The high-profile U.S. military presence only cast a pall on the otherwise peaceful South China Sea, through which more than 100,000 ships pass annually without incidents.</text:p><text:p>&quot;LAWFARE&quot;</text:p><text:p>The U.S. intervention won&apos;t end with military muscle-flexing. Observers said that the arbitration is part of the &quot;lawfare&quot; that the United States has waged against China, by manipulating lawsuits and legal systems to tarnish China&apos;s claims and rights.</text:p><text:p>Although the arbitration was initiated by the Aquino III administration in 2013, U.S. support and abetment were crucial to its being carried forward. The 3,000-page documents that the Philippines handed over to the tribunal were compiled with the help of U.S. legal experts who also participated in the process of deliberations.</text:p><text:p>The U.S. support, analysts said, is also a key factor that encouraged the tribunal to accept and then claim jurisdiction over the flawed case.</text:p><text:p>In 2010, then U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that Washington has national interests in the South China Sea, amid the U.S.strategic shift to the Asia-Pacific region.</text:p><text:p>The United States and the Philippines issued a joint statement to back the arbitration in 2014. Later that year, U.S. President Barack Obama, during a visit to Manila, voiced his support for the arbitration.</text:p><text:p>QUESTIONABLE JURISDICTION</text:p><text:p>Outwardly, Manila&apos;s request was to determine the nature of features &quot;under Chinese control&quot; in the South China Sea. But its real agenda was to confuse the maritime rights assigned to different features, e.g. islands, low-tide elevations or submerged banks, with China&apos;s sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and its waters.</text:p><text:p>By dwelling on the nature of the features, the Philippines has attempted to limit China&apos;s maritime rights and interests to individual features, denying China&apos;s historic rights over the Nansha Islands as a whole.</text:p><text:p>Hence, the Philippines&apos; requests are essentially about territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation. Territorial issues are subject to general international law rather than the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), under which the tribunal operates.</text:p><text:p>In addition, China excluded disputes concerning maritime delimitation, historic bays or titles from UNCLOS dispute settlement procedures in 2006, according to the UNCLOS stipulation.</text:p><text:p>HISTORICAL FACTS</text:p><text:p>Before the colonization of Southeast Asia by Western powers, the South China Sea had been a peaceful and prosperous hub for trade and cultural exchanges for over a thousand years.</text:p><text:p>In AD 671, the Chinese monk Yi Jing set sail across the South China Sea to study Buddhism in India and came back 25 years later. During his journey, Yi visited 30 ancient countries in the South China Sea region, during which he shared Chinese culture and technology with his hosts.</text:p><text:p>Yi was among more than 60 Chinese monks who traveled through the South China Sea to India during that period. Their writings and travel logs are evidence that proves China&apos;s active role in promoting peace and prosperity in the waters.</text:p><text:p>In various Chinese dynasties, offices on sea affairs were set up, along with the launch of coast patrols to ensure safe passage in the waterway. For about a hundred years, China had worked with the state of Malacca to combat piracy in the South China Sea, until Malacca was colonized by Portugal in 1611.</text:p><text:p>MEDIA MISINFORMATION</text:p><text:p>China&apos;s rights over the South China Sea are backed by numerous historical records. However, some Western media have either turned a blind eye to the facts or twisted them to make up their own version of the &quot;truth.&quot;</text:p><text:p>In Tanmen, a fishing village in southern China, a retired fisherman told BBC that he once had an ancient book with navigation directions to the South China Sea. But he threw it away as it was no longer readable after being used for hundreds of years.</text:p><text:p>Upon hearing this, the BBC reporter started to question the existence of the book, suggesting the old fisherman, who had trusted him with his family story, was lying. He went on to accuse Chinese media, which had first reported on the book, of having made up the story to bolster China&apos;s claims.</text:p><text:p>Had the reporter bothered to visit the Hainan Provincial Museum, he would have seen those ancient navigation guides on public display.</text:p><text:p>In fact, generations of fishermen living in a number of harbors in Hainan have relied on such ancient guides to navigate in the South China Sea. At least 12 versions of them can be found in museums or fishing villages.</text:p><text:p>NEGOTIATION THE ONLY WAY</text:p><text:p>Any ultimate resolution of territorial issues must be based on the will of the states involved. History, national interests and people&apos;s feelings of each side need to be acknowledged and taken into consideration before any reconciliation and agreement can be achieved.</text:p><text:p>A rushed decision by a third party often leads to more disputes and conflicts. In Southeast Asia alone, problematic demarcations by colonists left Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Cambodia with long-standing land disputes among them and even separatist violence.</text:p><text:p>The South China Sea issue involves waters of 3.5 million square kilometers and several parties in the region. Its magnitude and complexity far exceed the capacity of any tribunal.</text:p><text:p>In addition, China has made it clear that the arbitration is illegal, null and void, and that the country does not accept it or participate in it.</text:p><text:p>Without China&apos;s acknowledgement and support, the &quot;award&quot; of the arbitration is practically infeasible, or &quot;just a piece of paper,&quot; as described by former Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo.</text:p><text:p>&quot;China will never give up our lawful rights. Chinese people do not believe in fallacy nor are we afraid of evil forces,&quot; Chinese President Xi Jinping said on July 1, commemorating the 95th founding anniversary of the Communist Party of China.</text:p><text:p>&quot;Chinese people do not make trouble, but we are not cowards when involved in trouble,&quot; Xi said.</text:p><text:p>The newly-elected Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has on multiple occasions shown willingness to resume talks with the Chinese side, a good starting point for reconciliation and mutual understanding between the two countries.</text:p><text:p>Hopefully, this &quot;piece of paper&quot; can serve as a lesson to remind all parties involved that there is no shortcut to resolving the South China Sea issue, and that the final solution to it can only be found at the negotiation table. </text:p><text:p/><text:p/>

     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>by Xinhua Writer Jiang Li</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The South China Sea arbitration came to an end with an arbitral tribunal in The Hague issuing an award on Tuesday, but the verdict is null and void and only serves to complicate the situation in the region.</text:p><text:p>With obvious loopholes and deliberate proceedings circumventing regular arbitration rules, the tribunal undermines international law and sets a bad example for settling sovereign disputes.</text:p><text:p>China has reiterated its stance of non-participation in and non-acceptance of the arbitration. To fully respect international law and justice, China will never recognize the verdict and never be &quot;forced&quot; into accepting it.</text:p><text:p>The former Philippine government and the United States behind it have conspired for a long time to blackmail China regarding its historic rights to the South China Sea, but to do it through a tribunal that tramples on international justice goes too far.</text:p><text:p>For starters, Manila broke its own commitment made in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002, which was signed between China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to settle disputes through consultation and negotiation.</text:p><text:p>Without consulting with China over the means of dispute settlement, the former Philippine government unilaterally filed a compulsory arbitration against China in 2013.</text:p><text:p>Despite Manila&apos;s claim to seek a verdict over the status and maritime entitlements of relevant features in the Nansha Islands, the subject matter regards sovereignty and delimitation issues clearly beyond the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.</text:p><text:p>To make matters worse, some countries outside the region have been making waves to serve their own interests.</text:p><text:p>The United States has been attempting to &quot;fish in troubled waters&quot; while instigating the Philippines to act on the so-called legal front. Sending warships and warplanes and holding military maneuvers, the United States has spared no efforts to stir up the waters of the South China Sea with its so-called &quot;Pivot to Asia&quot; strategy.</text:p><text:p>Meanwhile, Japan is an accomplice that attempted to hijack the Group of Seven meeting in April with the South China Sea issue as part of its efforts to serve its audacious ambitions.</text:p><text:p>The arbitration has only escalated tensions in the region and by no means helps to solve the disputes. The undermining of international law and the repercussions of a law-abusing arbitration are even more worrying than the dispute itself.</text:p><text:p>The new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has expressed the desire to engage in dialogue with China on the South China Sea issue, which is a welcomed sign.</text:p><text:p>Under the dual-track approach initially proposed by ASEAN, China and the Philippines could negotiate in line with international law and get bilateral ties back on track.</text:p><text:p>It&apos;s high time to put an end to this farce that has dragged on for too long. </text:p><text:p>Related:</text:p><text:p>Backgrounder: A brief look at the South China Sea arbitration case</text:p><text:p>Full text of statement of China&apos;s Foreign Ministry on award of South China Sea arbitration initiated by Philippines</text:p><text:p>BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People&apos;s Republic of China on the Award of 12 July 2016 of the Arbitral Tribunal in the South China Sea Arbitration Established at the Request of the Republic of the Philippines issued on Tuesday.    Full story</text:p><text:p>Full text of Chinese gov&apos;t statement on China&apos;s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in S.

     </table:table-cell>
     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p>by Wang Wen, Yang Tianmu</text:p><text:p>MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine senior government officials Wednesday called on the Duterte administration to start bilateral talks with China immediately while ignoring the award issued by an ad hoc arbitral tribunal on the South China Sea issue Tuesday.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The negotiation must start immediately. And the arbitral ruling is both useless and irrelevant,&quot; said Valdes, former undersecretary of Philippine Department of Education.</text:p><text:p>Valdes questioned the validity of the award which claims Taiping Island as a rock despite the fact that the island has an airstrip, a hospital, several buildings and fresh water.</text:p><text:p>&quot;There is something wrong with the so called arbitration court,&quot; he said.</text:p><text:p>For Alberto Encomienda, former secretary-general of the Maritime and Ocean Affairs Center of the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department, the Philippines should not have taken the case to the tribunal in the first place.</text:p><text:p>He agrees with Valdes that the two governments should start to reconnect and talk bilaterally to solve the disputes as soon as possible.</text:p><text:p>In addition, the maritime expert believed &quot;if judged objectively, the ruling cannot be a leverage for the Philippines.&quot;</text:p><text:p>&quot;Let&apos;s begin from the beginning, rewind the clock, and go into consultations leading to negotiations and at the same time we work on joint development.&quot;</text:p><text:p>They have also voiced concern over the U.S. intervention into this regional issue.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The U.S. has been intervening too much in this region, even including on the matter of arbitration,&quot; said Encomienda.</text:p><text:p>When asked whether PCA&apos;s award will intensify conflict or even confrontation in the region, Encomienda said, &quot;if left to the two of us (China and the Philippines), the ruling should not intensify anything.&quot;</text:p><text:p>According to him, that&apos;s because right after the arbitral ruling came down, China issued a statement saying it adheres to the position of settling the issue through negotiation.

That policy stands still, like a rock.</text:p><text:p>As neighbors facing each other across the sea, China and the Philippines have been friends for generations. There were no territorial disputes between them until the 1970s, when the Philippines suddenly decided that some of China&apos;s islands and reefs were in fact theirs and occupied them without so much as a by-your-leave. China&apos;s reaction to this affront has been restrained, to say the least. It is not too great a leap of understanding to conclude that China is the encroached upon rather than the encroacher.</text:p><text:p>In 2013, the government of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III ignored previous agreements with China and went running to The Hague. Aquino has since become a figure of purely historical relevance, and the job of cleaning up his mess has fallen to the new Philippine President, Rodrigo Duterte, who seems ready and willing to talk directly with China.</text:p><text:p>Even after the absurd arbitration award, China retains its faith in a peaceful solution and would welcome direct talks over the negotiating table.</text:p><text:p>A statement issued by the Chinese leadership on Tuesday said that China is still ready to resolve disputes peacefully through negotiation and consultation with those states directly concerned. China will make every effort to seek win-win results and maintain the peace that is so vital to stability and prosperity in the region.</text:p><text:p>Bringing the issue back to the negotiation table, and thereafter to a long-term solution, is in the interests of all parties, and is now down to the Philippines. President Duterte has begun to make positive gestures, but is his country ready to walk his talk?</text:p><text:p>China has said that the door is always open, but will not welcome any unreasonable demands nor sit idly by if deliberately provoked.</text:p><text:p>China will now decide whether to declare an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the South China Sea in accordance with the extent of a threat. &quot;If our security were threatened, of course we have the right,&quot; Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin told the press.</text:p><text:p>Chinese people do not make trouble, but are not cowards when trouble is made for them. Whether the South China Sea becomes a troublesome tempest of confrontation or the peaceful waters of cooperation and common prosperity is up to the Philippines and its friends.</text:p><text:p>Is it not better to remain friends with a good neighbor than to allow some faraway superpower to stir up conflicts at the doorstep?

     <table:table-cell office:value-type="string" calcext:value-type="string"><text:p/><text:p/><text:p>JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has no jurisdiction over territorial issues and maritime delimitation, a well-known South African commentator wrote in The Star newspaper on Thursday.</text:p><text:p>The West sees the South China Sea arbitration as an important crossroads in China&apos;s rise as a global power, but there are misperceptions, Shannon Ebrahim wrote in the commentary titled &quot;How West misperceives and misconceives Chinese politics.&quot;</text:p><text:p>&quot;It is not; it has already risen. China is actually 10 steps ahead of the West in most cases, and Shanghai makes New York look like the old world,&quot; she said.</text:p><text:p>One mistake the West has made is to view the arbitral tribunal on the South China Sea issue as a legitimate process in international law, but there was no legal basis for the tribunal to begin with, Ebrahim said.</text:p><text:p>The compulsory arbitration was unilaterally initiated in 2013 by the administration of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III, whose term ended on June 30. It issued an award on July 12 that sweepingly sides with Manila&apos;s claims.</text:p><text:p>The arbitration was not only outside the jurisdiction of UNCLOS, Ebrahim wrote in the popular South African newspaper, &quot;it also disregarded the preference of China for direct negotiations and consultations with the Philippines.&quot;</text:p><text:p>The new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has indicated a readiness to discuss with China about the South China Sea issue.</text:p><text:p>&quot;This leaves open the possibility of negotiations, which China has always called for, China will not, however, accept the tribunal&apos;s ruling as the basis for settling the dispute,&quot; Ebrahim said.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The Western media is used to rallying around a cause without dissecting the credibility of that cause, and this is one such instance where the Western media has arguably been on the wrong side of history,&quot; she said.</text:p><text:p>The Washington Post has carried frequent headlines suggesting that China intends turning the South China Sea into an internal lake or a Chinese lake, without providing any proof to back up such claims.</text:p><text:p>&quot;The intended effect was to create the impression that China is the aggressor and not prepared to operate within the confines of international law,&quot; Ebrahim said.</text:p><text:p>She also noted that the reality of the situation is that the arbitral tribunal has no mechanism for enforcing its decision, and China will do exactly as it has stated all along -- simply ignore its findings.</text:p><text:p>In 1986, the United States ignored a ruling from the International Court of Justice that declared its mining in the harbors of Nicaragua illegal.</text:p><text:p>Washington is not a UNCLOS member. This leaves it with little credibility in terms of commenting on matters regarding adherence to UNCLOS.</text:p><text:p>&quot;It is an even greater double standard for the U.S. to have provided the rear guard support to the Philippines to unilaterally initiate the arbitration,&quot; Ebrahim said, adding that the arbitration is itself in violation of UNCLOS. </text:p><text:p/>

He said he does not want to go to war with China and that he is not interested in letting his country join America&apos;s &quot;free navigation&quot; action.</text:p><text:p>Duterte&apos;s gestures have given people a bit of confidence that the new Philippine government is trying to clean up the mess left over by his predecessor Benigno S. Aquino III, and bring relations with China back to the right track.</text:p><text:p>The invalid arbitration over the South China Sea, along with the subsequent political manipulation and Western media hoo-ha, has set a bad example of abusing international law and brought the issue to a dangerous and confrontational situation.</text:p><text:p>The current tension does no good to the China-Philippine relations, as well as the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. Bringing the disputes back to the right track of solution would serve the interests of both parties.</text:p><text:p>The Chinese leadership said Tuesday that China is ready to resolve disputes peacefully through negotiation and consultation with those states directly concerned. China will make every effort to seek win-win results and maintain the peace that is so vital to stability and prosperity in the region.</text:p><text:p>China and the Philippines are neighbors. The bilateral disputes are basically disagreements in the neighborhood, and can be solved through talks by the neighbors.</text:p><text:p>People expect the new Philippine government to show its sincerity with more concrete actions, and work with the Chinese side to properly manage and contain disagreements, so as to push bilateral relations back to its proper place.</text:p><text:p>Only by sealing a deal through equal negotiation among parties directly concerned can relevant disputes be fundamentally resolved, and the deal be effectively implemented.</text:p><text:p>Instead of being troubled waters, the South China Sea serves as a bridge connecting China and its neighbors. Maintaining the peace, stability and prosperity of the South China Sea is the common wish and responsibility of China and ASEAN members, and serves the interests of those countries.</text:p><text:p>As long as the parties insist on solving disagreements through negotiation and consultation and seeking win-win cooperation, the South China Sea will basically be a sea of peace and prosperity. </text:p><text:p/><text:p/>

Aquino III filed the arbitration against China in 2013, despite the agreement his country had reached with China on resolving disputes in the South China Sea through bilateral negotiations. Since then, China-Philippines relations have been severely deteriorated.</text:p><text:p>However, current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has expressed readiness and willingness to hold bilateral talks with China, saying that he is planning to send envoy to China to restart negotiations.</text:p><text:p>Li said that he hopes the South China Sea issue would be properly re-pulled back on the track of diplomatic negotiations on the basis of mutual respect and joint consultation.</text:p><text:p>He stressed that if China and Philippines decide to restart diplomatic mechanism, under no circumstances should the South China Sea arbitration be used as reference.</text:p><text:p>Organized by the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the one-day seminar attracted more than 20 experts from academic institutes in China and Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia. </text:p><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/><text:p/>
