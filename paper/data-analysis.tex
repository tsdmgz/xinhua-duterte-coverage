\section{Data and Analysis}\label{sec:data}

From the retrieved articles, I have chosen to look into two events,
including the week before and after to complete the coverage: the Hague
Tribunal ruling on the South China Sea dispute, and President Duterte's
first state visit to China. These two events were chosen because of the
significance of these events to both China and The Philippines and
received extensive coverage among major news outlets. Further, these
events usually go back to the president for statements or for guidance
on what the next course of action will be.

on the day of the hague ruling, there are several articles that talk
about the said ruling, which is not unusual in itself given the
sensitivity of the issue to both china and philippines. what is
interesting to look at is, the articles continued for six consecutive
days. even more interesting is that a common theme among these articles
are what i would best describe as opinions given by academics and
politicians across different countries. these countries are india,
argentina, brazil, mexico, south africa, czech republic, and
one being described as a ``European parliamentarian''.
