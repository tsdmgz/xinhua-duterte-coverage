MANILA, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is ""now truly free to follow what our national interest dictates,"" a senior Philippine official has said.
Martin Andanar, the communications secretary, made the comments in an opinion piece published Monday in the Philippine daily Inquirer.
He said Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has the valid reasons to be unhappy with the way the country's foreign policy was ultimately shaped by certain foreign country.
The president wants ""separation,"" which should work finely if the historical context which he wrestles with is considered as he strives to redefine the country's international ties, Andanar said.
Having thus done the work, ""we are now truly free to renew the ancient ties we had with our neighbors,"" he said, adding that the Philippines can freely associate with other nations.
""This is what a truly independent foreign policy should be,"" Andanar stressed, noting that it is certainly not about burning bridges with old friends.
The country's leader ""understands that fully - and boldly,"" he said.

c_135781850.htm|2016-10-26| Commentary: Japan should contribute to promoting peace in Asia-Pacific|"
by Xinhua Writer Chen Shilei
BEIJING, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- As the Asia-Pacific is seeing a growing consensus that maritime disputes should be handled via direct talks among parties concerned, Japan should stop stoking tensions in the region, and truly honor its promise to make peace.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is on a three-day visit Wednesday to Japan, a visit on which Tokyo has pinned hope to keep its ties with Manila tight amid concerns that Manila could ""separate"" from the alliance with the United States, Tokyo's key ally in the area.
The concerns were enhanced after Duterte, a recalcitrant leader in Washington's eyes, paid a visit last week to China at a time when China-Philippines ties have nosedived to a historical low due to the farcical South China Sea arbitration case brought by his predecessor Benigno Aquino III against China.
In fact, in the arbitration process, Japan and the United States -- both outsiders in the South China Sea disputes -- have relentlessly supported the former Philippine government.
Moreover, Japan is trying to rope other countries into speaking out on the South China Sea issue.
Tokyo is even planning on stepping up its activities in the South China Sea through joint training patrols with the United States and exercises with regional navies.
By stepping up its intervention in the South China Sea, Japan hopes to sufficiently distract Beijing so that it will be unable to handle maritime spats with Japan in the East China Sea at the same time.
Also, Washington wants Tokyo to help implement its strategy of rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific, and be a key counterbalance to a rising China. Japan seems to be quite cooperative in this.
Right now, peacefully resolving the South China Sea disputes through negotiations has become a consensus between China and other parties including the Philippines, a major territorial claimant.
And that is why Duterte and Chinese leaders were able to sit down together last week to discuss how to achieve overall improvement and greater progress in bilateral ties.
Of course, Japan is free to develop its ties with countries in the region, including the Philippines.
But it is advisable that Japan abandon its ambition to stir up regional tensions, and stop muddying the waters in the South China Sea. After all, peace and stability in the region are also in its own interests.

VIENTIANE, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Results of the recent visit by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to China will not only benefit peoples of the two countries, but also have positive effects on regional peace and stability, a Lao senior diplomat told Xinhua during an interview in capital Vientiane.
Soukthavy Keola, a former counselor at the Lao Embassy in China, said that the visit showed that the two countries are improving their bilateral relations.
""This is an opportunity, a turning point, and also an significant achievement in China's diplomacy.""
This is the first visit of Duterte outside the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). On Friday, China and the Philippines released a joint statement in Beijing with consensus on further enriching China-Philippines bilateral relations founded on mutual respect, sincerity, equality and mutual benefit, which is conducive to regional peace, stability and prosperity.
""China and the Philippines had witnessed some problems in bilateral relations which had impacts on the region. We were very worried about that,"" he said.
""Though problems could not be solved at once, the overall development of normal relations between the two countries should not be affected. Shelving disputes and seeking common development in cases of controversies are crucial to relevant countries and the region,"" Soukthavy told Xinhua on Friday.
""Now, we all focus on cooperation and seeking solutions, which has contributed to creating a friendly cooperation atmosphere in the region,"" he said, adding that the bilateral relations between China and the Philippines are ""back on track"", contributing to regional peace and stability.
There are huge potentials for the friendly cooperation between China and the Philippines. The two sides have many common interests in trade, economy and investment. ""China and the Philippines are both developing countries and neighbors.

BEIJING, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's visit to China shows the two countries have resumed friendly relations for win-win, which are also conducive to regional peace and stability, global observers and analysts told Xinhua.
The visit is significant in that it is not only Duterte's first visit outside the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), but also came ahead of his visit to the the Philippines' traditional allies, the United States and Japan, said Earl Parreno, a political analyst at the Institute of Political and Electoral Reforms in the Philippines.
""This visit could mean more investments coming into the country, more opportunities for businessmen and more employment for Filipinos. It could also mean markets for Philippine products like bananas and pineapples,"" said Parreno.
Ngeow Chow Bing, deputy director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya, also spoke highly of Duterte's visit to China, saying that the China-Philippine relationship going back on track is conducive to regional peace and stability.
The relationship between China and the Southeast Asian countries is comprehensive and complex, which involves not just military or security issues, but also trade, cultural and tourism opportunities, the Malaysian expert said.
Soukthavy Keola, a former counselor at the Lao Embassy in China, said the result of Duterte's visit is of strategic importance to the region.
The development of cooperation between the two countries will have a positive influence on cooperation between China and ASEAN countries, said Keola.
Li Mingjiang, an associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, said Duterte's visit is an obvious adjustment of Philippine foreign policy, especially about its relations with major world countries.
Different from his predecessor Benigno Aquino III, who largely depended on the United States in his foreign policy, Duterte has adopted a policy of diversifying friendly relations with major world countries and his visit to China reflects this policy, said Li.
""It is expected that in the next few years, China-Philippine relations will return to the normal track, and cooperation in many areas will be strengthened,"" he said.
Pierre Picquart, an expert in Geopolitics and China at the University of Paris VIII, told Xinhua that Duterte has chosen the path of reason ""rather than promoting geopolitical, economic and territorial tensions about the South China Sea, and unlike his predecessor Benigno Aquino.""
""This is a peaceful way, with bilateral negotiations and path of economic growth in partnership with Beijing for win-win partnerships in the region,"" Picquart said, hailing that the ""former American colony now seems to break his ancestral chains.""
Bambang Purwanto, director of international department at Indonesia's Antara News Agency, said Duterte has made a good start on relations with China and the two countries should strike for positive results from the current visit to create a good atmosphere.
""I am sure that the visit will ease the tension in the South China Sea, and start the process to make the two peoples know each other, to know that cooperation is the right way to develop bilateral ties,"" said Purwanto.
Duterte arrived in Beijing Tuesday night for a four-day state visit to China, the first country he has visited outside ASEAN since taking office in June.
The visit came against a backdrop of deteriorating China-Philippines ties due to the South China Sea arbitration case unilaterally initiated against China by his predecessor Benigno Aquino III.

 Commentary: Rekindling Beijing-Manila ties carries no meaning for Philippine-U.S. alliance

"|"
by Xinhua writer Liu Chang
BEIJING, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is now in Beijing to warm up his country's ice-cold ties with China. The move has nothing to do with Manila's traditional alliance with Washington.
As Chinese President Xi Jinping rolled out red carpet to welcome his Philippine counterpart on Thursday morning, many around the world were predicting that the Southeast Asian nation was getting ready to pivot away from the United States, its traditional ally.
Some even said that Beijing would receive handsome gains if the Philippine-U.S. alliance truly gets weakened.h These observers are wrong although they think they have proofs as the new leader in Manila has been an open and fierce U.S. critic and threatened to cancel his country's joint military drills with U.S. armed forces.
The Chinese government never attempts to build up its ties with other countries on condition that these nations have to sacrifice their partnership with any third party.
To be more specific, the most important thing Beijing seeks to get from a sound bilateral relationship with the Philippines is that the two sides can work together to strengthen their economic and trade cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit as well as respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
It's totally up to the Philippine authorities to decide how they are going to handle their relations with other parties, including the United States.
If America's partnership with the Philippines has indeed started to unravel, perhaps the very first thing politicians in Washington need to look into is their own way of doing business with the country they consider as a key ally in the Asia-Pacific region. And it is unfair and meaningless to scapegoat either China or Mr. Duterte.
They should also know that to sustain a partnership, they need to at least learn how to be respectful and stop being bossy.
Now that the Philippine leader is in China to fix the impaired ties, he will almost surely return home with his hands full as the two nations are expected to reach a series of agreements and step up their cooperation in areas such as fruits trade and anti-narcotics.
True friends need to be candid and honest. The visit is also a fine opportunity for the two governments to start their talks on the South China Sea dispute.
A proper handling of their maritime dispute, especially after the law-abusing arbitration episode that led bilateral ties to fall to a historical low, would build a solid foundation for the two countries to further their future cooperation without worrying that the island spats could relapse as time rolls on.

MANILA, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has posted 32.6 billion pesos (676.59 million U.S. dollars) budget surplus in August, dragging down the eight-month fiscal gap to 138.4 billion pesos (2.87 billion U.S. dollars), the Department of Finance said Thursday.
The surplus in August was the first under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, the department said.
During the month, government revenues reached 209.6 billion pesos (4.35 billion U.S. dollars), up by 19 percent from the same month last year, while expenditures rose by 9 percent in the same month last year.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III earlier said the Duterte administration would be responsible with its finances as it reverses the underspending in the previous administration.
The new government has committed to raising public investments in infrastructure, human capital and social protection for vulnerable sectors, as part of President Duterte's 10-point socioeconomic agenda to sustain high growth and make its benefits trickle down to all Filipinos.
But to help raise needed funds for public investments, the government is pursuing a comprehensive tax reform program to discourage evasion and avoidance, broaden the tax system's narrow base and make the current system simpler and more equitable.
The department of Finance last month submitted to the House of Representatives the first package of its proposed Tax Reform Roadmap for Acceleration and Inclusion Act in keeping with the Duterte administration's 10-point socioeconomic agenda.

Xi urged both countries to integrate their development strategies in a comprehensive manner to seek mutual benefit and win-win results.
China is willing to actively participate in the Southeast Asian nation's infrastructure construction, covering railway, urban rail transit, highway, port and other areas, so as to benefit the Philippine people, according to Xi.
China is also ready to encourage Chinese businesses to invest more in the Philippines to help the country's economic growth, said the Chinese president.

MANILA, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) made Tuesday the ""soft opening"" of a Chinese-funded rehabilitation center in the northern Philippine province of Nueva Ecija.
Health Secretary Paulyn Jean Ubial said at a news briefing in Malacanang, the presidential palace, that about 1,000 newly hired personnel conducted a dry run on how to manage the patients who will be referred to the facility located inside military's Fort Magsaysay in Laur, Nueva Ecija.

The newly built facility can accommodate up to 10,000 patients.
""Six weeks after the foundation was laid, the building structures gradually took shape and now, almost 50 percent of the facility has been constructed. The right wing of the building, which can accommodate almost 1,000 patients and offices are now ready to be furnished,"" Ubial said.
The DOH also plans to build rehabilitation centers in Visayas and Mindanao.
When President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office in June, he declared a war on illegal drugs. Since that time, about 790,000 drug addicts have surrendered to authorities.

BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte left Brunei for China Tuesday after wrapping up his first state visit to the sultanate.
During his three-day state visit to Brunei, both countries reaffirmed commitment in bolstering economic cooperation with each other.
In a speech during a state banquet for the visiting Philippine President at Istana Nurul Iman, Brunei's Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah said both countries' historical links and common heritage have paved the way for strong bilateral relations that are demonstrated through cooperation in various areas, including trade and investment, labour, defence, health, education and air services.
""Today, there remains much potential to be tapped in our economic cooperation,"" said the monarch, adding that this includes reinforcing collaboration in the energy sector and discovering new areas in the halal industry.
The monarch also expressed appreciation on the contribution of about 23,000 Filipino expatriates to Brunei's economy and development.
In his speech, Duterte expressed his ""heartfelt gratitude"" towards the Sultan for the 32 years of friendship and assistance accorded to the Philippines and its people.
Duterte also spoke on how both countries have faced various common challenges and overcome these obstacles.

MANILA, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court said on Tuesday that it has extended anew the status quo order ante on the burial of late President Ferdinand Marcos at the heroes' cemetery to Nov. 8, a spokesman for the high court said.
Theodore Te, the spokesman, told reporters that the high court will continue its deliberations on whether or not Marcos deserves a space in the hallowed cemetery reserved for revered soldiers and past Philippine leaders.
Last Aug. 23, the high tribunal decided to delay the ruling for 20 days, or until Sept. 12. At the conclusion of the oral arguments last Sept. 7, however, the high court again extended the status quo order to Oct. 18.
A status quo order may be issued by a court to prevent any of the parties involved in a dispute from taking any action until the matter can be resolved.
President Rodrigo Duterte, a close friend of the Marcoses, has allowed the transfer of Marcos body from his home province of Ilocos Norte to the heroes' cemetery in Manila, drawing both criticisms and support from Filipinos.
Groups against the burial have filed petitions, urging the high court to stop the plan to bury Marcos in the cemetery. The Marcos family and supporters also filed petitions to counter the claims of the anti-Marcos groups.
Marcos was elected in 1965 but overthrown in 1986 when millions of Filipinos, backed by the military, took to the streets to protest the dictator's corrupt administration. He died while in exile in Hawaii in 1989.
His body, which was brought back to the Philippines in 1993, is now on display inside a glass box in an air-conditioned mausoleum beside the family's ancestral home in Batac, north of Manila.
The Marcos family, pleading for an ""honorable burial"", had lobbied the government for Marcos' remains to be interred at the heroes' cemetery in Manila. But the anti-Marcos and human rights groups had opposed the plan, saying the disgraced leader does not deserve a military honor and a plot in the hallowed ground.

MANILA, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has sent an invitation to the United Nations rapporteur Agnes Callamard to probe the increasing number of drug-related killings in the country, a government spokesman said on Wednesday.
""Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said the palace has sent the invitation to the UN rapporteur Agnes Callamard and is awaiting her response,"" Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella told a news conference at the Malacanang presidential palace.
In the invitation, Abella said the ""palace also urged - and I think it is notable - the UN rapporteur to include in her investigation the killing of law enforcers by drug suspects so she could obtain accurate perspective of the drug problem in the country.""
He said the Philippine government is urging Callamard to also look into the killings of law enforcers who were also killed in the campaign to eradicate illicit drugs.
News reports said more than 3,000 suspects had been killed, some extrajudicially, in the fight against drugs since President Rodrigo Duterte took the presidency on June 30.
Duterte said there are at least 4 million Filipinos who are into drugs. He warned that if not eradicated, the Philippines will continue to be governed by narco-politicians.
The Philippine senate and the House of Representatives have conducted investigations into the drug menace.
The UN, US, European Union and other international human rights groups have criticized the Duterte administration for carrying out a bloody anti-drug campaign, prompting Duterte to lash at these critics.
Despite the intense criticisms, Duterte has vowed to continue his anti-drug campaign.
As of Oct. 10, the Philippine National Police said that a total of 1,550 suspected drug users and pushers have been killed since July 1. On the other hand, the police said at least 13 policemen and three soldiers were killed.

MANILA, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte hailed China on Tuesday for helping his administration's war on illicit drugs by offering to build a rehabilitation center that can house 1,600 drug dependents.
""China offered to help. It's about to be completed,"" Duterte announced during an oath-taking ceremony at the Malacanang presidential palace.
He said the new facility, which he describes as ""an apartment-style, similar to a condominium,"" is being build inside a Philippine Army camp in Nueva Ecija, north of Manila.
He said the building is a secured rehabilitation facility that is hoped to decongest the overly crowded police jails in the country.
The facility sits inside the camp called Fort Ramon Magsaysay, the largest military reservation in the Philippines and one of the key training areas of the Philippine Army.
Duterte is waging a war against ""narco-politics"" in the Philippines, saying about 4 million Filipinos are into illegal drugs. He has reiterated that the Philippines lacks the budget to build rehabilitation centers for drug dependents.

BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Oct. 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to visit Brunei from Oct. 16-18 after his initial visit to the sultanate was cancelled last month due to a deadly blast in his home city of Davao.
Duterte's visit to Brunei is part of his rounds among fellow leaders of ASEAN member states to further strengthen the Philippines' close ties with each country in the regional bloc, local media reported Sunday.
Duterte is expected to be accompanied by his official delegation, senior government officials and officials from other Philippine government agencies.

Lorenzana said the three suspects were arrested Oct. 4 in Cotabato City, also in southern Philippines. He said three were on board a motorcycle without a license plate when arrested.
""They attempted to evade the mobile checkpoint that our security forces set up along a highway in Cotabato City,"" he said.
""The three terrorists had direct participation in the Sept. 2 Davao City bombing,"" Lorenzana told a news conference.
Lorenzana presented the three suspects to the media. He said the military and the police are now doing follow up operations to arrest the remaining suspects.
""The operation recovered solid pieces of evidence showing that they are indeed the terrorists who bombed the Davao City market,"" he said.
Lorenzana said the police and military personnel manning the check point also seized materials for making improvised explosive devices and guns, including sub-machine guns and .45 cal pistol and cellular phones.
One of the suspects was allegedly the triggerman who made the phone call that detonated the improvised explosive device, he said.
Lorenzana said another suspect reportedly planted the IED placed inside a backpack bag, while the third suspect was the one who took the video of the incident.
He said the three were members of the Maute group, a criminal gang operating in central Mindanao. The gang has been blamed for several bomb attacks and kidnapping for ransom in the region.
The motive of the bombing was to disrupt the military offensive to crush the Abu Sayyaf bandits in Sulu province that started in July and subsequent operations in central Mindanao that started in August, Lorenzana said.

MANILA, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said Friday that the respective unilateral ceasefire declarations of the Duterte administration and the leftist National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) are holding as their peace talks resumed in Norway.
Government peace panel head, Labor Secretary Silvestro Bello III, made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the second round of talks in Oslo, the third party negotiator in the peace process.
""The significant impact of the indefinite ceasefire declared by the parties cannot be overemphasized, including the confidence of our peace constituency on the peace process. We note that the ceasefire is holding until this day, with no major violations reported by either party,"" he said.
He described this as ""unparalleled achievement,"" which should inspire both parties to advance the negotiations.
Bello expressed optimism that a joint ceasefire could be signed this month as what was envisioned during the first round of talks in September.
The second round of talks focuses on social and economic reforms, which the NDFP described as the ""meat of the peace negotiations"" and the ""heart and soul of the peace negotiations.""
""This is because it would involve addressing one of the principal causes of the ongoing armed conflict: widespread poverty along with issues of unemployment, underdevelopment, social injustice and so on,"" NDFP said in a statement.
But new NDFP panel chair Fidel Agcaoili raised the long-standing concern of the group regarding the release of over 400 political prisoners.
NDFP said it has kept its obligation on its unilateral ceasefire declaration.
""However, the promise to release the political prisoners seems to be suffering from delay after delay after delay,"" said NDFP, the political wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army.
Agcaoili warned that if ""this anomalous situation continues,"" it can serve as a ""disincentive"" to the NDFP in further pursuing the discussions on prolonging the ceasefire and arriving at a bilateral agreement on a more stable ceasefire.
The Philippine government is eyeing to complete the negotiations with the leftist rebel group in the next 12 months to provide the current administration to efficiently implement the agreements reached, Bello said.

MANILA, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is eyeing an additional 1 trillion pesos (20.7 billion U.S. dollars) for public investments annually with comprehensive tax reform measures that it has been pushing in Congress, a senior government official said Monday.
Department of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said if this is achieved, some 10 million Filipinos could be freed from poverty in six years' time and eventually transform the Philippines into a high-income state by 2040.
""To meet President (Rodrigo) Duterte's goal of freeing 10 million Filipinos from the shackles of poverty under his 10-point socioeconomic agenda for inclusive growth, the government needs to reduce the poverty incidence from 26 percent in 2015 to 17 percent when his term ends in 2022,"" Dominguez said.
""For this administration to do so, it must raise enough funds to accelerate public spending on infrastructure, human capital and social protection for the most vulnerable sectors. To achieve more inclusive growth, higher tax revenues are needed,"" said Dominguez.
The Department of Finance submitted last month to both chambers of the Congress its proposed Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act in keeping with the Duterte administration's 10-point socioeconomic agenda.
Public investments are estimated to reach 1.273 trillion pesos (26.3 billion U.S. dollars) this year, of which 621 billion pesos (12.8 billion U.S. dollars) will be in infrastructure; 454 billion pesos (9.4 billion U.S. dollars) in education, 128 billion pesos (2.6 billion U.S. dollars) in health, 60 billion pesos (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) in social protection, and 10 billion pesos (210 million U.S. dollars) in training, research and development (R&D) and other programs.
Dominguez said the Duterte administration wants public investments to almost double to 2.29 trillion pesos (47.4 billion U.S. dollars) each year.
Hence, it needs an extra 1.017 trillion pesos (20.7 billion U.S. dollars) per year to double public spending on infrastructure, human capital and social protection over the next 24 years till 2040, he said.

For 2017, the revenues are expected to reach 2.48 trillion pesos, 10 percent higher than 2016 collections and equivalent to 15.6 percent of GDP, said Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno in a forum with businessmen.
""Revenues are also targeted to increase by 11 to 12 percent annually to reach 4.68 trillion pesos or 18.1 percent of GDP by 2022,"" he said.
Diokno said the target higher revenues could be achieved through more efficient tax administration and the passage of new revenue measures being proposed by the Department of Finance (DoF).
""We will reform the tax system to make it more equitable, efficient and competitive in the region. A number of reforms will be pursued, primarily the lowering of personal and corporate income tax rates from 32 percent and 30 percent, respectively, to 25 percent,"" he said.
The loss in revenues due to income tax cuts will be offset by expanding the Value-Added Tax (VAT) Base, the official explained.
""We aim to remove the exceptions not related to agriculture, health, banking, education and the financial sector. This will result in additional revenues amounting to 68.6 billion pesos in the first year of implementation,"" he said.

Specifically, Duterte said that both Southeast Asian countries ""will seek to identify emerging areas of partnership particularly in the fields of maritime security and law enforcement.""
Seeking counter-drug cooperation is also on the president's agenda. He said the Philippines and Vietnam shall also seek ways ""to advance collaboration in the campaign against illegal drugs trade, consistent with the goal of realizing an ASEAN Drug-Free Community.""
""We will work with Vietnam and the rest of ASEAN in suppressing the proliferation of illegal drugs for us to secure a better future for our nest generation and the generation to come,"" Duterte said.

MANILA, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday accused the United States of ""undermining"" the Philippines economy and causing the Philippine peso to tumble against the U.S. dollar.
""The Americans are undermining us now. They are manipulating ...the peso weakened,"" Duterte said in a speech at the Philippine marine headquarters in Taguig.
The Philippine peso hit a seven-year low on Monday, closing at 48.25 to a dollar, the weakest since the close of 48.335 on Sept. 15, 2009.
Duterte told the marine troops that ""the Americans are bullying the Philippines,"" adding that the U.S. has disrespected the Philippines.
The Philippines is a treaty ally of the U.S., with Manila depending too much on the U.S. for military and other assistance.
However, Duterte said the U.S. ""cannot understand a friend.""
""Instead of helping us, they will attack you,"" he said.
If the U.S. will continue putting pressure and manipulating the Philippines, Duterte warned, ""I will have new alliances of commerce and trade.""
He begged for the understanding of the marine troops. ""This Republic will rise. This Republic of the Philippines will continue to be great,"" he said.
""Time will come that we don't need them anymore. We will survive on our own. We fight our wars on our own and we will win as a country,"" Duterte said.
Some sectors blamed the depreciation of the peso on Duterte's acerbic statements against U.S. President Barack Obama and the United Nations.
However, Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno told a news briefing at the Malacnang presidential palace that Duterte's statements has nothing to do with the peso depreciation, saying the weakening of the peso is ""a result of the strengthening of the dollar, more than weakening of the peso.""
""And why is the dollar strengthening? Because of the impending increase in the interest rate by the Fed. This has been ongoing for several quarters already,"" Diokno said.

""I am about to cross the Rubicon with the U.S. It is a point of no return,"" he said in a speech during an oath-taking event at the Malacanang presidential palace.
The idiom to ""cross the Rubicon,"" means to pass a point of no return, and refers to Julius Caesar's army's crossing the Rubicon River in northern Italy in 49 BC, which was considered an act of insurrection and treason.

BEIJING, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- China expects an early visit by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and the two countries are in close communication over the issue, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Friday.
According to media reports, Duterte is planning separate visits to China and Japan next month, which will be his first trips outside southeast Asia since assuming office on June 30.
In response to a question that whether the China-Philippine disputes on South China Sea will affect the visit, the spokesman Lu Kang told a routine press briefing that as long as the two sides have the will to settle their disputes through consultation, there are no difficulties that can not be overcome.
Tension between China and the Philippines has risen in recent years over the South China Sea issue, especially since the former Philippine government initiated a case against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2013. An ad hoc arbitral tribunal set up at Manila's request issued a highly controversial and biased award in July, denying China's long-standing historical rights in the South China Sea.
China has reiterated that it will not accept any proposition or action based on the decision.
Lu said countries in the region have agreed to adhere to a dual-track approach on the South China Sea issue, with disputes to be resolved peacefully through direct negotiations between parties concerned, and to work together to maintain peace and stability.
""We hope countries outside the region will respect the consensus reached by China and countries surrounding the South China Sea,"" Lu added.

Capt. Ryan Lacuesta of the Philippine Marines said the amphibious landing exercises will open on Oct. 4 at the Philippine Marines headquarters in Fort Bonifacio in the Philippine capital.
The U.S. Embassy in Manila has yet to issue an official statement on the scheduled landing exercises next week.
U.S. President Barack Obama has called off a bilateral meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meetings in Laos early this month, following Duterte's tirade against Obama after the latter criticized Duterte's violent war against drugs in the Philippines.
In a speech at the inauguration of a power plant in Misamis Oriental in southern Philippines on Thursday, Duterte reiterated that he would not allow Philippine military to participate in joint patrols in the South China Sea.
Earlier this month, Duterte also said he wanted the more than 100 U.S. Special Forces posted in Mindanao out.
""(Those special forces), they have to go. They have to go,"" he said during a speech at the Malacanang presidential palace in Manila.

""I will write them a letter to invite them for an investigation,"" said Duterte.
Duterte on Tuesday slammed the EU parliament for issuing a statement calling for the government to ""put an end to the current wave of extrajudicial executions and killings in the Philippines.""

Duterte on Wednesday demanded the EU to show him some respect because he is the president of the Philippines, and not a city mayor anymore.
Duterte has earlier lambasted the UN, the United States and its President Barack Obama for voicing concern over the spate of drug-related killings.
Duterte, who took office June 30, is waging an all-out war against illicit drugs and criminality in the country.
From July 1, police statistics showed more than 3,313 suspected drug paddlers and users have been killed. The police have carried out nearly 19,000 police operations that led to the arrests of more than 18,000 drug suspects. More than 700,000 drug suspects have also surrendered, the police said.

MANILA, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian officials have started exploratory talks on possible military-to-military cooperation with Philippine officials in Moscow, including the acquisition of Russian military equipment and technology, the Philippine ambassador to Russia said in a statement on Wednesday.
Carlos Sorreta said officials from the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, the federal agency directly under the Office of the President of Russia, briefed the Philippine embassy in Moscow ""on the different aspects of possible Philippines-Russia military cooperation.""
Sorreta said the federal agency is responsible for control and oversight in the field of military-technical cooperation between Russia and foreign counties.
""This is all part of our job to explore opportunities that could contribute to our government's efforts to modernize our defense capabilities,"" Sorreta said.
Sorreta described the meeting ""quite revealing, particularly as to the extent that Russia is able to interact with a large number of countries in this field and the different mechanisms that are employed, including in terms of the acquisition and transfer of Russian military equipment.""
During the briefing, Sorreta said both sides also discussed ""military equipment and technology that were available from Russia.""
He said both sides also discussed about possible ""training, after-sales service and maintenance, transfer of technology, investment in domestic military production and servicing, and different modes of financing.""
Russia sells military equipment and military-related equipment to a host of nations, from highly developed countries like the United States to developing nations like India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, he said.
The Philippines is ""open to cooperating with the Russian Ministry of Defense through education and training exchanges on counter-terrorism operations,"" Philippine officials said.
The Philippines and Russia have been exploring the possibility of ""enhancing defense and security cooperation,"" noting that Russia ""can be an important partner"" for the Philippines fight against terror.
Defense Undersecretary Natalio Ecarma has posted out that ""Russia's own experience in combating terrorism and extremism, within and outside its borders, could give is fresh perspectives on how to deal with these challenges more effectively.""
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has earlier said that he is muling sending Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana to Russia and China to check on military equipment available for the Philippines.
Gen. Ricardo Visaya, the Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff, told a congressional hearing on Wednesday that there is not instruction yet from Duterte to buy military equipment from China and Russia.

 Commentary: Japan should join ""trend of times"" over South China Sea issue

"|"
BEIJING, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- While a ""dual-track"" approach, peaceful negotiation and joint efforts to secure stability have become the norm in the South China Sea issue, some still don't like the situation.
Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada said Thursday in Washington that she strongly supports U.S. ""freedom of navigation"" operations in the South China Sea and threatened to increase engagement in the waters.
The new defense minister also said that Japan would conduct ""joint training cruises"" with the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea.
Japan's attempt to intervene in the South China Sea issue becomes increasingly bare and bold.
Always pointing the finger at China, Japan also supports the farcical arbitration started by the former Philippine government.
Japan has shown an ardent interest in the issue at the G7 summit and other international platforms, claiming concerns about ""freedom of navigation,"" ""status quo"" and ""prevailing norms.""
Does anyone actually believe this talk, considering the rise of right-wing forces in Japan?
One possibility is that Japan intends to use the South China Sea issue, which involves multiple parties, to muscle in on regional security affairs.
The United States' ""Asia-Pacific Rebalance"" strategy gives Japan the chance to use the South China Sea issue to snuggle up even closer to the United States, especially now that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has questioned how the U.S. military are behaving in his backyard.
Through ""China threat"" rhetoric, Japan may find a way to whitewash its underhand expansion of its Self-Defense Forces' activities both at home and overseas, and its posturing over the East China Sea.
The only problem with Japan's little scheme seems to be that those directly concerned in the issue are not remotely interested in its predictable drama.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Monday noted that China and ASEAN had reached agreement on how to handle the issue at their leaders' meeting earlier this month following similar agreement at the foreign minsters' meeting in July.
Everyone expects the new Japanese defense minister to do something useful for the Asia-Pacific region.
It would be wise for Inada, and for her country, to stop trying to ignore the ""trend of times"" and begin to follow it.

""I read the condemnation of the EU against me. I will tell them, 'fuck you.' You're doing it in atonement for your sins,"" Duterte said in a speech in Davao City, his hometown in the southern Philippines.
Duterte called the EU hypocrites, citing the alleged killings committed by France and Great Britain against the Arabs.
The EU has called on the Philippine government to ""put an end to the current wave of extrajudicial executions and killings"" of people who are allegedly hooked on illicit drugs.
The EU parliament has also directed the EU delegation in the Philippines and the embassies of 28 European countries in the Philippines to monitor rights abuses following Duterte's declaration of a ""state of national emergency on account of lawlessness"" on Sept. 3.
More than 3,000 alleged drug users and pushers have been killed since Duterte took office on June 30, according to police and media records.
Duterte has vowed to eradicate drug-related criminality in six months. But last Sunday he said he needs another six month more, given the severity of the drug problem besetting the country.

""Extra-judicial killing is not a policy of this administration. We will never condone any unlawful killings,"" he said.
The call of the European Parliament to launch an immediate investigation is already being addressed as President Rodrigo Duterte has already instructed authorities to look into these incidents and bring the perpetrators to justice, Andanar explained.
As to the specific, comprehensive policies and programs in compliance with human rights, he said plans for the construction of drug rehabilitation centers are now underway.
The president has also directed the military to allot some of their idle lands for these centers as part of the second phase of the anti-drug war, which is the rehabilitation of drug dependents, he added.
He noted that at least four rehabilitation centers will be built this year, two in Luzon, one in the Visayas, and one in Mindanao.
Since Duterte assumed office on June 30, over 700,000 drug users and pushers have surrendered to authorities while more than 3,000 drug suspects were killed, most of them allegedly perpetrated by vigilantes.

""Once implemented and completed, these approved projects will help attain our medium- and long-term development goals of making the agricultural sector competitive, improving mobility by making our transport system safer and more efficient, increasing disaster resiliency, and improving health services,"" said Pernia, also NEDA director general.
The nine projects include Inclusive Partnership for Agricultural Competitiveness; Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center Modernization; Modernization of Gov.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte (C) arrives to attend the 11th East Asia Summit (EAS) in Vientiane, Laos, Sept. 8, 2016. (Xinhua/Qin Qing)
BEIJING, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Tuesday that his country will no longer participate in joint patrols with the United States in the South China Sea, describing such patrols as ""a hostile act.""
On Monday, Duterte said that U.S. special forces in southern Philippines should leave.
Such decisions and remarks by Duterte showed signs of subtle changes in the relationship between Manila and Washington.
Duterte's spat and confrontation with the U.S. began from the recently-concluded Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit.
On Sept. 5, Duterte said before flying to Laos to attend the summit that he is a leader of a sovereign country and is answerable only to the Filipino people.
He was answering a reporter's question about how he intends to explain the extrajudicial killings to U.S. President Barack Obama. More than 2,000 suspected drug pushers and users have been killed since Duterte launched a war on drugs after taking office on June 30.
""I do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody. You must be respectful. Do not just throw questions. Putang ina, I will swear at you in that forum,"" Duterte said, using the Tagalog phrase for ""son of a bitch.""
Duterte expressed regret over the remarks the next day, but the damage was done. His expletives against Obama prompted the latter to cancel their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting.
In the same gathering during the East Asian Summit, Duterte veered away from the prepared speech and instead talked about the massacre perpetrated by the American forces against Filipino Muslims in the southern province of Sulu in 1906, which he described as human rights violation.
Furthermore on Tuesday, Duterte abandoned the hidden rule that the Philippines always buys weaponry from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Instead he announced that he was thinking of buying weapons from China and Russia, and would dispatch experts to the two countries for on-the-spot investigations.
Duterte's recent remarks illustrate the new Philippine president's intent to keep a distance from America in a bid to maintain balance between his country's relationships with the U.S and China.
According to analysts, the reason Duterte wishes to uphold an independent foreign policy is to avoid getting entangled in a possible U.S.-China confrontation, or even worse, being crushed in a conflict between the two giants.
Duterte believes being too close to the U.S. is as equally dangerous as being too close to China, analysts say. He aims to take the middle route between the two powers to avoid irritating both while reaping the benefits of a balanced relationship.
However, keeping a distance from its American ally doesn't necessarily entail conflict. The core interests between the Philippines and the U.S. remain.
The Philippines and the U.S. signed three vital defense treaties - the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951, the Visiting Forces Agreement in 1999, and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement in 2014.
The Philippine foreign affairs ministry, defense ministry and armed forces have all recently reiterated the validity of the three pacts. Duterte himself also promised before his inauguration that the Philippines would continue to maintain the treaties.

""The (United States) special forces, they have to go,"" said Duterte in a speech at the oath taking ceremony of newly appointed officials in the presidential palace.
The president said that during his attendance at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit and Related Summits in Laos last week he wanted to mention the plan, but he did not raise this ""out of respect.""
""I do not want rift with America, but they have to go,"" he said.
Duterte said he wanted the U.S. forces to leave Mindanao because they might be targeted by the kidnap-for-ransom groups.
Earlier, the president has said the Philippines under his administration would pursue an independent foreign policy ""without any interference"" from any country.
In Vientiane, controversy hounded Duterte for making ""strong remarks"" against U.S. President Barack Obama in connection with comments made by U.S. officials on drug-related extrajudicial killings in the country.
Duterte's remarks prompted Obama to cancel a scheduled meeting with Duterte on the sidelines of the ASEAN meetings.

KUALA LUMPUR, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian police have confirmed that the three crew members of a fishing trawler who were kidnapped in waters off Malaysia's Sabah on Saturday are Filipinos, according to a report from Bernama, Malaysia's state news agency.
A Sunday report from Bernama quoted Sabah police chief Abdul Rashid Harun as saying that the three Filipinos were taken by a group of seven heavily-armed men during a fishing trip with 13 other crew members on Saturday night.
""During the incident, the seven masked abductors, carrying pistols and high-powered M-16 rifles, approached the ship on a speed boat and went onboard,"" said the report, adding the crew members were ordered to lie on the floor when the gunmen ransacked the vessel, which is Malaysia registered.
It is yet to determine whether the gunmen are affiliated with the Abu Sayyaf, an Islamist militant group based in the southern Philippines, which is notorious for kidnappings-for-ransom.
The incident came two days after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte visited Indonesia, during which the two countries vowed to tackle sea kidnappings jointly.
According to a report from the Star, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi also weighed in on the incident, saying Malaysian authorities were facing several obstacles in preventing such cases, including a lack of equipment for the forces to carry out their duties.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo met with his Filipino counterpart Rodrigo Duterte at the State Palace on Friday, expressing commitment to fight against extremism in both nations.
""We expressed commitment to take all necessary steps to ensure security in the two seas and maritime areas of common interest,"" President Duterte told a joint press conference.
The commitment was made as hijacking, mostly undertaken by Abu Sayyaf bandits in the regional waters, has been on the rise since earlier this year.
A total of 25 Indonesian seamen and scores of foreign nationals have been held hostage by Abu Sayyaf captors; 14 of the Indonesians have been released and two others escaped.

 China opposes outside interference in South China Sea issue: Vice FM

"|"
VIENTIANE, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) -- It is not appropriate for some countries outside the region to push the so-called South China Sea ""arbitration"" at the East Asia Summit, which runs against the trend of solving disputes through dialogues and consultations, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said on Thursday.
All leaders of ASEAN countries speaking at the summit supported the efforts that have been made by China and ASEAN countries to implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), Liu told a press briefing after the summit.
Only two countries outside the region proposed to push the ""arbitration"", Liu said, adding that instead of solving problems, such a meddling act can only expand differences and contradictions, to which China is firmly opposed.
China and ASEAN countries have made positive efforts in implementing DOC and the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC), he said, noting that before the ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting in July 2017, the two sides will complete drafting a COC framework so as to let consultations enter a substantive discussion phase.
""Some countries outside the region intend to meddle after seeing regional nations make progress on strengthening cooperation,"" Liu said, adding that ASEAN nations have realized that the issues in the region should be solved through dialogues and consultations among the countries in the region.
ASEAN countries have learned that the key to solving the South China Sea issue should be held in their own hands and they should return to the channel of a complete and effective implementation of the DOC, and only strengthening cooperation and building mutual trust can safeguard East Asia's peace and security and maintain its economic prosperity, he said.
""The page about arbitration has been turned over,"" he said, adding that China hopes countries concerned should not sow discord again between China and ASEAN.
""It is the Cold War mentality to count on bilateral defense cooperation and military alliance to safeguard East Asian peace,"" Liu said, stressing the need to formulate a new Asian security concept.
Meanwhile, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has sent a signal of improving bilateral relations with China after he took office, and China is confident that Sino-Philippine ties could be improved with the joint efforts of the two sides.

MANILA, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte proclaimed on Monday a state of national emergency for the Philippines on account of lawless violence, a Malacanang presidential palace said in a statement.
Presidential Communications Office Assistant Secretary Kristian Ablan told reporters that ""the proclamation technically took effect today and remains in force until lifted by the president.""
He said Duterte ""can call out the military as commander-in-chief by virtue of the constitution.""
He said the proclamation commands the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippines National Police (PNP) to undertake measures permitted by the constitution and laws.
Ablan said the proclamation is mainly ordering both the AFP and the PNP to ""suppress all forms of lawless violence in Mindanao and prevent lawless violence from spreading elsewhere across the country.""
He said the state of national emergency on account of lawless violence gives ""due regard to fundamental and civil political rights and has nothing to do with martial law or the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.""
""It's just a stepped-up campaign of the police and the military to ensure the safety of the general public,"" Ablan said.
The proclamation of a state of national emergency for the Philippines came barely three days after Duterte declared ""a state of lawlessness,"" which authorized the military and the police ""to run the country"" in the wake of the terror attack Friday night at his hometown in Davao City.
The attack claimed the lives of 14 people and injured almost 70 others.
Police said the still unidentified perpetrators used a cellular phone-activated improvised mortar to carry out the attack.
A few hours after the attack, Duterte visited the bomb site shortly before dawn Saturday and told reporters, ""I am declaring state of lawless violence. It's not martial law, but I am inviting now the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the military and the police, to run the country in accordance with my specifications.""
Duterte clarified that the ""state of lawlessness"" is not synonymous to martial law, adding it merely requires ""well-coordinated efforts of the military and the police.""
""There will be major checkpoints,"" Duterte said, adding that there is no suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. ""I have this duty to protect the country. I have this duty to keep intact the integrity of the nation,"" he said.
Duterte was in his hometown Davao City when the blast ripped off a crowded strip of the night market shortly after 10 p.m. Friday.

MANILA, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar told ABSCBN News Channel television interview Saturday morning that President Rodrigo Duterte will push through with his trip to Brunei, Indonesia and Laos where he will attend the Asean summit.
Andanar said that the decision was made after an ""emergency meeting"" with some Cabinet members, police and military officers in Davao City after the deadly blast in Davao City Friday night that killed 14 and wounded 67 others.
""That's the general assessment that internally, meaning domestically in our country, and also internationally,"" Andanar said.
A powerful explosion rocked a crowded night market late Friday in Davao City, the hometown of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
The explosion went off around 10:30 p.m. along Roxas Avenue, a place that is converted into a night market. People crowd the street at night to eat in affordable eateries that serve grilled food.
Duterte was in the presidential guesthouse in Panacan village, some 15 kilometers away when the explosion happened, his aides said.
The tough-talking Philippine leader, who had been mayor in the city of 1.2 million people for over 20 years before winning the presidency last May, was expected to go to the site of the incident, officials said.
Andanar said that initial police investigators showed that ""the shrapnels came out of an improvised mortar used as an explosive device.""
""We are not ruling out the other possibilities until the investigation is done,"" he said.
Andanar said the police reported to Duterte that at least 14 were killed and 67 were wounded in the Friday's blast.
Duterte has ordered an all out military offensive against the extreme group Abu Sayyaf in retaliation against the killing of 15 government troops in fierce fighting against the group in the south.
Andanar said the attack ""is either a reprisal of the terrorists in Jolo, Sulu due to the government's operations or wars against terrorism there or the second possibility could be the reprisal of the drug lords.""
Since he assumed the presidency on June 30, about 2,000 people have been killed in the Philippines in its war on drugs. The blast took place amidst reports that there are groups who are out to assassinate Duterte who is now waging bloody war against illicit drugs.
Andanar said Duterte has already ordered the police and military to set up check points all over Davao City.

MANILA, Aug. 28 (Xinhua) -- Armed men believed to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group have stormed a jail in the southern Philippine Malawi City, freeing at least 28 prisoners, authorities said on Sunday.
Police officer Agustine Tello, chief of the Lanao del Sur provincial police, said the jailbreak took place around 5:40 p.m. on Saturday in Mapandi Village in Marawi City.
He said the attackers, numbering about 50, were heavily-armed and easily took control of the local jail.
Among the escapees were eight members of the so-called rag-tag Maute group who were arrested last Monday for possessing improvised explosive materials and guns. Twenty other prisoners escaped during the attack, he said.
Tello also said the attackers disarmed the jail guards and carted away one M16 rifle, on M14 and a vehicle as they escaped.
Brig. Gen, Restituto Padilla told radio dzBB in an interview that the military is helping the police in the manhunt to re-arrest the gang members and the jail breakers.
""We have heightened the alert level in the region,"" he said, adding that pictures of the escapees have been disseminated.
The Maute group has been blamed on several bomb attacks and kidnapping for ransom in central Mindanao.

OSLO, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and communist rebels on Friday agreed to implement a ""unilateral"" ceasefire for an indefinite period after week-long peace talks in Oslo to end Asia's longest-running insurgency.
The agreement was part of a joint declaration by the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), an umbrella organization of Marxist groups including the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed group, the New People's Army.
""In the course of a few days, the parties in the Philippine peace process have reached agreement on issues that have blocked progress for many years,"" said Norwegian foreign minister Borge Brende, whose country has facilitated the peace process over the years.
""Among the most important points that have been agreed is that both parties will implement a unilateral ceasefire for an indefinite period,"" Brende said. ""This has never before been achieved in this peace process and is regarded as a major breakthrough.""
According to a statement from the Norwegian foreign ministry, the two parties have agreed to speed up the peace process and aim to reach the first substantial agreement on economic and social reforms within six months.
They plan to follow this up with an agreement on political and constitutional reforms, before a final agreement on ending the armed conflict can be signed, it added.
The formal peace talks between the government and the leftist rebels resumed on Monday after they had been stalled since 2011.
The two negotiating panels agreed to meet again in Oslo on Oct. 8-12.
While there is no joint truce yet, NDFP peace panel chair Luis Jalandoni said the Communist Party of the Philippines will declare and issue ""an indefinite ceasefire order"" to the New People's Army and its militia, upon the end of their current seven-day truce order on Aug. 27.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte already declared last week an indefinite ceasefire to pave the way for the resumption of peace talks with communist rebels.
Both the government and the NDFP will work for the declaration of bilateral truce within 60 days and to establish a ceasefire monitoring committee, Jalandoni said.
As Duterte became new Philippine president this June, his administration is keen to forge peace with the rebels.
The peace talks first began in 1986. Yet over the years, no tangible results were made. Norway has facilitated the peace process since 2001. The last formal round of the negotiations took place in 2011.
The rebels began its insurgency in 1969 and reached its peak in 1987 when it boasted 26,000 armed guerillas.
However, the movement has since dwindled due to differences in strategy and tactics, as well as the arrest of many of its top leaders in the late 1980s. According to the Philippine military, the group now has around 4,000 members.

De la Rosa also said about 300 police officers are also protecting drug lords.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has earlier named active and retired police generals who are allegedly protectors of drug syndicates.

OSLO, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said Monday it was possible to sign a peace agreement with communist rebels within a year as the two sides resumed peace talks in Norway's capital city in an attempt to end Asia's longest-running insurgency.
Talks are scheduled from Aug. 22-26 between the negotiating panels of the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the umbrella organization of Marxist groups including the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed group, the New People's Army.
Both sides have a common understanding about speeding up the peace process and ""we have imposed a timeline of nine to 12 months,"" Silvestre Bello, the Philippine labor minister and head of the government negotiating team, told a press conference after an opening ceremony of the talks.
His NDFP counterpart Luis Jalandoni also said that the peace process could be accelerated as both sides showed their commitment for peace recently, including the two sides' declarations of a ceasefire and the government's release of about 20 rebel prisoners who are needed in the peace negotiations.
""With the commitment for just and lasting peace, declared by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and the leadership of the NDFP, Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army, we are confident we can decisively move forward towards achieving a just and lasting peace,"" Jalandoni said in his speech at the opening ceremony.
Norway's Foreign Minister Borge Brende said it was good to see the parties gathered in Oslo on a historic day and Norway felt a great responsibility as a facilitator for the talks.
""We shall have five very demanding days here,"" Brende was quoted as saying by NTB news agency.
Philippine Presidential Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza, who is also in Oslo as a leader of the government delegation, said last week that the talks were expected to tackle ""social and economic reforms, political and constitutional reforms, end of hostilities and disposition of forces, a ceasefire, joint security and immunity and the release of political detainees.""
The peace talks came after the Philippine government declared after midnight on Sunday an indefinite ceasefire to pave the way for the Oslo talks and the rebels also declared a seven-day ceasefire beginning at the same time.
The rebels said in a statement earlier Monday they are considering to match the indefinite ceasefire declared by Duterte if the government will release five more detained rebel leaders who will act as ""consultants"" in the talks plus the 520 other ""political prisoners"" who are still in jails.
But Duterte in a news conference early Sunday said he was not inclined to release more prisoners, saying he had already released 20 including the two highest-ranking rebel leaders who are already in Oslo.
The Duterte administration is trying to forge peace with the communist rebels. Talks between the government and the rebels began in 1986, but failed to lead to a resolution over the years.
Norway has facilitated the peace process since 2001. The last formal round of the negotiations took place in 2011.
The communist rebellion began in 1969 and reached its peak in 1987 when it boasted 26,000 armed guerillas. However, the movement has since dwindled due to differences in strategy and tactics and the arrests of many of its top leaders in the late 1980s. The Philippine military estimates the current number of communist armed rebels to be around 4,000.

MANILA, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine National Police Director General Ronald de la Rosa said on Monday a total of 1,779 people have been killed in the Philippines' war on illicit drugs since July 1.
He told a senate inquiry that 712 were killed in ongoing police operations while 1,067 died in ""vigilante-type"" killings, meaning ""outside of police operations.""
De la Rosa said in his opening statement that the Philippine National Police's ""stand against extrajudicial killings is uncompromising.""
""If any cop is found violating the law of self-defence he will be investigated, prosecuted and accordingly punished,"" he said.
""On the speculation of vigilante killings, the PNP does not and will never condone vigilante killings,"" he added. ""I have previously mentioned that these killings are perpetrated by various syndicate groups involved in illegal drugs.""
De la Rosa vowed to apply the ""full force of the law against those responsible for these killings"" outside of police operations.
The increasing number of killings in the administration's war against drugs has caught the attention of the United Nations and other international human rights groups.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte however is unfazed by the growing criticisms, repeatedly saying the fight against drugs will be relentless and will be sustained.
""I am willing to answer all (my critics). I assume full responsibility for what happened because I was the one who ordered it,"" Duterte told a news conference in Davao City at the weekend.
""My instructions at the very first day of my term were that: go out and hunt for these criminals. Arrest them if they surrender peacefully but if they put up a violent stunt then you just have to kill him because I do not want people in government dying needlessly for doing his work when you were then leaving behind a family and children,"" he said.
The president lamented that the government is also losing an average of two or three police officers in every drug operation launched by the police.
Duterte has singled out a senator, police generals, judges and politicians who were allegedly involved in illicit drugs operations in the country.
He said drug addiction has become a pandemic, saying there are an estimated 3.7 million Filipinos who are hooked into drugs. So far, he said 600,000 drug users and pushers have ""surrendered"" and took the drug test since his administration launched the campaign when he took over the presidency on June 30.

MANILA, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- The communist rebels have urged Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to free more prisoners as peace talks between the government and the rebels resume this week in Oslo, Norway to end Asia's longest communist insurgency, the rebels said in a statement on Monday.
The rebels said they are considering to match the indefinite ceasefire declared by Duterte if the government will release five more detained rebel leaders who will act as ""consultants"" in the talks plus the 520 other ""political prisoners"" who continue to languish in jails.
The rebels are also demanding the""immediate release"" of a male peasant leader in Quezon province who was arrested on Aug. 12 and a female""missionary"" who was arrested on Friday in Cebu City.
But Duterte in a news conference early Sunday said he is not inclined to release more prisoners, saying he had already released 20 including the two highest-ranking rebel leaders who are already in Oslo. ""Now if I will release all the prisoners, the (rebels) already in custody, then there's no point negotiating. I will be left with no more cards.""
The government declared after midnight on Sunday an indefinite ceasefire to pave the way for the Oslo talks.
The rebels have also declared a 7-day ceasefire beginning after midnight Sunday. The stalled on-an-off formal negotiations between the two sides are expected to start in Oslo on Monday.
""The Communist Party of the Philippines hopes it could soon match (the government's) indefinite ceasefire declaration with a unilateral declaration of an interim ceasefire. This declaration can be issued soon after the completion of the release of at least five more (rebel) consultants and around 520 political prisoners nationwide through a presidential proclamation of general amnesty as earlier broached by (Duterte),"" the rebels said.
""Hopefully, Duterte can issue such a proclamation soon after the resumption of peace talks in order to encourage the CPP to expeditiously issue its declaration of interim ceasefire during the course of the peace negotiations.""
The rebels said these issues are among the top items in the agenda of the scheduled talks on August 22-26 in Oslo between the negotiating panels of the government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, the umbrella organization of Marxist groups including the CPP, and its armed group, the New People's Army.
""The CPP and all revolutionary forces recognize the extra effort of Duterte to boost the peace talks,"" the rebels said.
""After the current 7-day ceasefire declaration by the CPP lapses on Aug. 27, and until the CPP can issue a unilateral declaration of interim ceasefire, the CPP can task the NPA to stand down and remain on active defense,"" said the rebels. ""Details will be issued after the Oslo talks.""
Aside from the release of their detained comrades, the rebels also expressed concern over particular provisions of the operational guidelines reissued by the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
""In these guidelines, the chief of staff orders AFP troops to continue with so-called 'peace and development' operations under the much-detested Oplan Bayanihan. These operations, such as those being carried out in Davao del Norte, have been used in the past to justify the militarization of communities in the guerrilla zones and to carry out surveillance and harassment operations against community activists and leaders whom the AFP suspects of being members of local CPP branches and peasant organizations,"" the rebels said.
The rebels also demanded that the military withdraw its forces in some areas and to stop making arrests of their comrades.

MANILA, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte
declared on Saturday an indefinite ceasefire to pave the way for
resumption of peace talks with communist rebels next week, said
Presidential Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza.

The peace talks are scheduled for Aug. 22 in Oslo, Norway.
President Duterte has ""restored the effects of the unilateral
ceasefire with the Communist Party of the Philippines and the
National Democratic Front effective 12 midnight tonight, Aug. 21,""
Dureza told a news conference at the international airport before
leaving for Oslo with the government panel.

""The duration of the ceasefire will last for as long as
necessary to bring peace in the land,"" he said.

Duterte declared a unilateral ceasefire on July 25 but scrapped
it six days later after the rebels failed to reciprocate and
attacked and killed a militia man.

""The enabling environment brought about by this 'silencing of
the guns' will hopefully go a long way in bringing about an
expeditious and early resolution to our differences and aspirations
that have long divided us as a people,"" said Dureza.

He said the restoration of the ceasefire came a few days after
Duterte has released from detention about 20 prisoners who are
needed in the peace negotiations.

""As we speak there is continuing efforts to make available in
Oslo peace talks resumption as many of them as possible,"" Dureza
said, referring to the remaining political prisoners that will take
part in the talks as ""consultants.""

The Philippine government released from jail on Friday two
communist leaders, Benito Tiamzon and his wife, Wilma, to allow
them to participate in the Oslo talks.

The Tiamzons are the highest-ranking communist leader in
detention after they were arrested in 2014. The government said
Benito Tiamzon was the chairman of the Communist Party of the
Philippines while his wife Wilma was the secretary general.

A few hours after their release, the Communist Party of the
Philippines declared a seven-day unilateral ceasefire that will
take effect 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 21 and will last until 11:59 p.m. on
Aug. 27.

""This ceasefire declaration is encouraged by the (Philippine
government's) facilitation of the release of the nearly all
National Democratic Front of the Philippines consultants who are
set to participate in peace negotiations in the course of the next
several months,"" the rebels said in a statement.

The Oslo talks are expected to tackle ""social and economic
reforms, political and constitutional reforms, end of hostilities
and disposition of forces, ceasefire, joint security and immunity
and release of political detainees,"" according to Dureza.

The Duterte administration is trying to forge peace with the
communist rebels. Talks between the government and the rebels began

MANILA, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine gross domestic product grew 7 percent in the second quarter of the year, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia announced Thursday, making the Philippines the fastest growing economy in the region.
Pernia told a news conference in Davao City the growth is ""an upbeat start"" for the new administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, saying investments had the highest contribution to the growth followed by industry.
""The growth is within market expectations, given average consensus forecast of 6.1 to 7.2 percent for the second quarter,"" Pernia told a news conference in Davao City.
He added, ""This strong growth increases the probability of our attaining the revised full-year 2016 real growth projection of 6 to 7 percent.""
With the first semester GDP growth of 6.9 percent, the economy will need to grow by at least 5.1 percent in the second half of the year to attain at least the low-end of the growth target, he said.
""While it is normal to see a slowdown in the second semester during election years, the smooth transition of power and assurance of macroeconomic policy consistency and continuity by the new administration will likely keep business and consumer confidence strong to meet the full year target,"" Pernia said.
Pernia said investments had the highest contribution of 5.7 percentage points to GDP growth.
""Investments on durable equipment registered an increase of 42.8 percent and private sector investments in construction, which grew to 8.3 percent from 8.1 percent in the first quarter. This growth was driven by stronger business confidence, low interest rates, and strong performance of the construction sector,"" he said.
He said public spending remained strong, driven by the boom in public construction and government consumption, which grew by 27.8 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively.
Similarly, he said private consumption grew stronger in comparison to the previous quarter and year due to the low inflation and interest rates, improved labor market conditions, and steady consumer confidence.
""Overall, domestic demand growth accelerated to 12.3 percent from 12.0 percent in the first quarter of 2016,"" he said.
In contrast, Pernia said external demand weakened further, as exports of goods and services continue to slow down to 6.6 percent, despite the 15.3 percent growth of services exports.
Conversely, he said imports of goods rose to 22.9 percent largely due to increased purchases of captal goods and durable, which indicate an increase of investments from firms.
""Services imports remained strong at 13.3 percent, significantly higher than the 10.3 percent in the previous quarter,"" he said.
On the supply side, Pernia said the acceleration of economic growth was ""fairly broad-based,"" adding the high growth recorded for the first quarter of this year was driven by gains in the industry and services sectors.
He said the industry sector recorded a growth of 6.9 percent, which is higher than the 6.1 percent growth in the previous year, supported by manufacturing, construction, and utilities.
He added that the services sector recorded an 8.4 percent growth fuelled by faster growth in trade, transport communication, public administration and real estate, renting and business activities.
In contrast to the robust industry and services, Pernia said the performance of the agriculture sector remains dismal at -2.1 percent due to the lingering effects of El Nino. He voiced concern over ""a developing risk of La Nina"" that will likely intensify between August and October this year.
""This highlights the urgency of crafting holistic agriculture development policies that include disaster resiliency. This will benefit workers form the sector, which employs the biggest chunk of our labor force,"" he warned.
He further warned that despite the good numbers for the first six months of 2016, there is still a risk of seeing a lower growth rate in the second half of the year. ""This is a normal occurrence during election years. Consumer sentiment will also likely normalize given the post-election season."" he said.
Over the medium-term, Pernia said the new administration is aiming still for a steady acceleration of growth towards 7 to 8 percent this year.
""This will be supported by sustained reforms, including a comprehensive tax reform, sustained investment in infrastructure, easing of restriction of foreign investments, reduction of cost of doing business and strengthening of agro-industrial linkages,"" he said.

MANILA, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered concerned government agencies to facilitate the travel of leftist rebel consultants who will participate in the formal resumption of talks later this month, a government peace panel official said Tuesday.
Government peace panel member Angela Librado-Trinidad said the president instructed the Bureau of Immigration and the Department of Foreign Affairs to assist the consultants of the National Democratic Front (NDF), the political wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines - New People's Army (CPP-NPA), who will be travelling to Oslo, Norway for the August 22 formal talks.
About 10 detained high-ranking leftist rebels, including couple Benito and Wilma Tiamzon, have been allowed to post bail to be able to join the peace negotiations in Norway, the third party facilitator in the peace process.
Duterte met Monday in Malacanang, the presidential palace, NDF lawyers, assuring that the released consultants will fly to Oslo, said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III, who heads the government panel negotiating with the NDF.
Jesus Dureza, presidential adviser on the peace process, will head the Philippine delegation during the opening ceremony.
""The President said, that while he was hurt by the sharp exchanges between him and CPP founding chair Jose Maria Sison who is based in The Netherlands, he gave assurances that he will walk the extra mile for peace,"" Dureza said.

MANILA, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Philippine government official said Monday that a previous agreement, supposedly signed between the Philippine government and the family of former President Ferdinand Marcos about the location of his burial, does not bind President Rodrigo Duterte who has the discretion and authority to amend or modify certain arrangements made before him.
Salvador Panelo, Chief Presidential Legal Counsel, said he has not yet seen the said agreement which supposedly stated that the body of Marcos would be allowed to return to the country provided that it is not buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, Heroes' Cemetery.
Filipinos who were tortured, jailed, raped, illegally arrested and whose relatives disappeared when Philippine former President Ferdinand Marcos imposed martial law in 1972 asked the Supreme Court on Monday to stop the government's plan to bury him in the heroes' cemetery.
""For one, assuming there is an agreement, it does not bind the President because that was entered into by previous presidents,"" he said of the reported agreement signed between the Marcoses and the government under then President Fidel Ramos.
He added that based on his understanding of former interior secretary and ally of Ramos, Rafael Alunan III, the agreement and conditions stated were made based on the circumstances then.
Panelo said the circumstances at present may already be different from the conditions now.
He cited for instance that Duterte, with the overwhelming support from the public during the May 2016 elections, has the authority to make decisions and arrangements that he sees fit and applicable to the present time like allowing the burial to finally put an end to the issue and allow the country to finally move forward.
Panelo said Duterte, having promised during the campaign that he would allow the burial of Marcos if he becomes president, is also just making true his earlier campaign promise.
He said voters are well aware of Duterte's stand even before he became president and still voted for him which means that the public is giving him the authority to fulfil his promise.
Panelo added that the burial of Marcos, apart from being allowed under the law, does not change the fact that the state at one time had recognized that there were human rights violation under the Marcos presidency and is in fact in the process of indemnifying the victims.
Under the Armed Forces of the Philippines' Regulation 161-375, those who may be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani include soldiers, veterans and former presidents, among others.
Malacanang earlier said there is no date set yet as to when the burial would occur but said that Marcos would be accorded honors fit for a president.
The former president died in 1989 in Hawaii or three years after he was booted out of power and forced to leave the country following the Edsa People Power Revolution of 1986.
His body had been flown back in 1993 and had been in state in his hometown of Batac in Ilocos Norte in northern part of the country since then.

Duterte lamented that corrupt government employees and officials are hindering the administration's anti-corruption drive.
""It seems it is difficult to weed out crooks in government. Corruption is so chronic in this country that you need another generation of workers to do the job,"" he said.
Indeed, he said corruption remains a ""perennial problem"" in the Philippines. ""It's still there and I still have to show tomboy the list of the rest of the scallywags in government. More judges, more policemen mainly and some politicians,"" he said.

It was not until after I became president (that I realized the gravity of the illegal drugs problem facing the country),"" he said, adding, ""I was appalled by the number of addicts in this country.""
He said his administration has so far recorded 600,000 drug users and pushers who ""surrendered"" to the government.
""But two years ago, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency said there are about two million drug addicts in this country. And considering the length of time, there must have been some incremental increase. It's really a pandemic thing. It is not an epidemic; it;s a crisis pestering the country,"" Duterte said.
He said he is unfazed by criticisms hurled at him by his detractors who think his anti-drug campaign is becoming too violent and bloody with the number of suspected criminal killed steadily rising.
""I might come out as a villain with stained hands, maybe soaked with blood but there is no way to stop it now,"" Duterte said. ""There can be no stopping of the momentum until I have destroyed the apparatus.""
He said he is doing everything to get at the bottom of the illicit drug problem and those countries that ""are controlling the flow"" of illegal drugs.
Again, Duterte warned, ""I will give you a clean government then I will crush the drug problem and criminality, and even if I have to soak with blood, so be it.""

MANILA, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Vicitms of the martial law imposed by former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972 asked the Supreme Court on Monday to stop the government's plan to bury him in the country's heroes' cemetery.
In a statement, the Samahan ng Mga Ex-Detainees Laban sa Detention at Aresto or SELDA, an organization of martial law victims, said they filed the formal petition to ask the court to issue a temporary restraining order ""to disallow"" the burial of Marcos in the hallowed cemetery.
The group said in their petition that Marcos ""is not entitled to any hero's burial,"" adding that he ""overly abused"" the presidency during his rule and faked his military record.
The petition also cited the study conducted by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines belying the claim of Marcos of being a World War II hero and bemedalled soldier.
""The interment of the remains of Marcos at the heroes' cemetery with honors that supposedly befit only Filipino heroes with overall unblemished integrity and dignity is contrary to the constitution,"" the group said.
They also cited a 1992 agreement between the Philippine government represented by then President Fidel Ramos and the Marcos family that Marcos' remains will be buried in their hometown in Ilocos Norte, a province north of Manila.
""To abandon the agreement, to reboot the entire process, exhume his remains and allow his burial at (the heroes' cemetery) is to relive the terror and horrors of his victims who have, until now, not been given justice,"" the group said.
It added, ""While his victims will be forgotten, Marcos will be remembered as a president given a hero's burial in violation of the law and even their contractual commitment with the Philippine government.""
They said that burying Marcos in the heroes' cemetery ""will not achieve the purpose of closure espoused or accepted by others.""
The filing of the petition came a day after at least 1,000 martial law victims and anti-Marcos activists held a protest rally to stress that Marcos is not a hero and to denounce President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to bury Marcos in the heroes' cemetery.
Duterte, a friend of the Marcoses, has allowed the burial of Marcos in the heroes' cemetery, stirring up an old debate on whether or not Marcos deserves the honor.
Marcos, who ruled the country for two decades, died in exile Hawaii in 1989 three years after the Marcos family fled the Philippines following a popular uprising that ousted the dictator in 1986 when millions of Filipinos, backed by the military, took to the streets to protest his abuses.
The Marcos family has long been dogged by accusations that the former president oversaw massive human rights abuses and plundered billions of dollars from the state.
His body, which was brought back to the Philippines in 1993 after he died in Hawaii in 1989, is now on display inside a glass box in an air-conditioned mausoleum beside the family's ancestral home in Batac, north of Manila.
The Marcos family, pleading for an ""honorable burial,"" had lobbied the government for Marcos' remains to be interred at the heroes' cemetery in Manila. But the anti-Marcos and human rights groups had opposed the plan saying the disgraced leader does not deserve a military honor and a plot in the hallowed ground.

MANILA, Aug. 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine crime volume fell by 9.8 percent year-on-year in July, one month after President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office, as the latest number of the drug suspects who were killed hit 592, a senior government official said Sunday.
Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar said the Philippine National Police recorded crime volume of 50,817 in July from 56,339 during the same period last year.
Duterte has vowed to address criminality during the first three to six months of his administration.
Andanar said the index crime also went down by 31 percent to 11,800 in July from 17,105 last year.
He said the significant drop in the crime incidents in the country only shows the ""strong and quick action"" of the Duterte government.
In the campaign against illegal drugs, Andanar also cited that authorities have already conducted 5,422 operations from July 1 to Aug. 14.
The operations resulted in the killing of 592 suspected drug personalities and arrests of 8,332 others.
The total number of drug users and pushers who surrendered has reached 554,243.
Some groups, including the United Nations and the United States, have raised concern over the extrajudicial killings in the Philippines against individuals who were allegedly involved in illegal drugs.

MANILA, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Saturday to address two concerns raised by the U.S. embassy in Manila earlier, but ignored the embassy's concern over President Rodrigo Duterte calling U.S. Ambassador to Manila Philip Goldberg ""gay"" and ""son of a bitch.""
On Friday, the U.S. embassy issued a statement saying the comments were ""inappropriate and unacceptable.""
In a speech before army troops on Friday, Duterte mentioned a lunch meeting with visiting U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Manila last month.
Duterte said Kerry, who offered more than 30 million U.S. dollars in aid for law enforcement training, was ""OK"" but he criticized Goldberg, saying ""I had a feud with his ambassador, his gay ambassador. Son of a bitch.""
The U.S. statement clarified that the 32-million U.S. Dollar -pledge is not new funding and that ""assistance provided by these funds is subject to the same rigorous vetting.""
The embassy also voiced concern over the ""extrajudicial killings"" of people suspected to have involved in the illegal drug activities in the country.
The Philippine statement said it ""took note"" of the concerns raised by the U.S. embassy but directly addressed only the two issues, and completely ignored the remarks on the ""gay"" issue.
Duterte told reporters Friday that he would not apologize to Goldberg, adding that the American envoy was not at all sorry for what he said during the presidential campaign period.
Goldberg earned the ire of Duterte when the envoy criticized then presidential candidate Duterte for making light of the rape and killing of an Australian woman missionary during a jail riot in Davao City in 1989.
The Office of the President released to media the foreign department statement, saying the Duterte administration welcomes the media statement issued by the U.S. embassy.
""We took note of their on issues of mutual concern,"" it said.
""We do not condone any unlawful killings and Philippine authorities have been instructed to immediately look into these incidents and bring the perpetrators to justice,"" it added.
""Law enforcement officials are expected to abide by legal procedures and strict operational protocols. Alleged violations of these protocols will be investigated by the authorities and those who have broken the law will be prosecuted,"" the statement said.
It also stressed that the Duterte administration is ""committed to the rule of law"" in its campaign against illegal drugs.
""The Philippine government is focused on its peace and order efforts, including the eradication of illicit drugs and its manufacture, distribution and use from our society. Nevertheless, while pursuing this objective, the Philippine government is committed to the rule of law, and the protection of human rights of all,"" the statement read.
The statement said Manila welcomes U.S. embassy's ""reaffirmation of the longstanding ties between the Philippines and the United States, and the importance of the strategic alliance vis-Ã -vis our shared values and shared goals.""
""We look to the substantial and meaningful assistance of the United States in pursuit of our own national objectives, especially in addressing the issues of counterterrorism, maritime security and economic cooperation,"" it said.

MANILA, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- Filipinos who were tortured, jailed, raped, illegally arrested and whose relatives disappeared when Philippine former President Ferdinand Marcos imposed martial law in 1972 intends to ask the Supreme Court to stop the government plan to bury Marcos in the heroes' cemetery, a spokesman for the group said Saturday.
Trinidad Herrera, of the Samahan ng Mga Ex-Detainees Laban sa Detention at Aresto or SELDA, said their group plans to file a petition with the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari next week.
""We want the Supreme Court to issue a temporary retraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction to stop the Department of National Defense and the Armed Forces of the Philippines from conferring national honors to Marcos through the burial at the heroes' cemetery,"" Trinidad said.
"" If such misdeed happens, it will be a grave injustice to the thousands of victims of extrajudicial killings, enforces disappearances, illegal arrests and detention, torture and harassment perpetrated by the Marcos fascist regime,"" he added.
Herrera is one of the 9,539 human rights victims who filed a class suit against Marcos in Hawaii. They won the case.
""Marcos is no hero. He was a murderer, torturer and a plunderer. To confer national honors to Marcos is a defilement of the people's historic struggle against the tyranny of martial law,"" Herrera said.
Herrera reiterated the victims' call to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to reconsider his decision ""to give such honors to a dictator, and instead hasten the process of indemnification of the victims and relatives.""
""Even in the sunset years of our lives, we will continue to fight for justice for all victims of martial law and state fascism,"" Herrera said.
The Marcos burial issue has again stirred heated debates on whether Marcos deserves a burial befitting a hero after Duterte said he would allow the dictator to be buried in the heroes' cemetery.
Duterte, a close friend of the Marcoses, believes that burying Marcos in the heroes' cemetery will ""erase hatred"" and heal the country.
Preparations are underway for the Marcos burial. A spokesman for Duterte told reporters that the exact for the burial has yet to be decided but Marcos's only son and namesake, former senator Ferdinand Marcos, announced that it would take place on Sept. 18.
Anti-Marcos groups are planning to mount a series of activities starting next week hoping that Duterte will change his mind.
Marcos, who ruled the country for two decades, died in exile Hawaii in 1989, three years after the Marcos family fled the Philippines following a popular uprising that ousted him when millions of Filipinos, backed by the military, took to the streets to protest Marcos abuses.

KUALA LUMPUR, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rejuvenated the peace process in the Southern Philippines on Saturday by launching the implementing phase of the peace agreements.
The meeting held in the Malaysian capital is the first under President Rodrigo Duterte, two years after the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) between the Philippine government and MILF in 2014 facilitated by Malaysia.
Philippine presidential adviser on the peace process Jesus Dureza hailed the entering of implementation phase as another milestone in the peace process, stressing the commitment by the new Philippine administration to honor previous peace agreements.
Manila's commitment was partly demonstrated by the high level delegation at the meeting, including cabinet members like Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay and senior lawmakers.
Murad Ebrahim, chairman of MILF, said continuing the peace process remains the only reasonable and viable pathway that could bring progress, development and lasting peace to the Philippines.
He said MILF would welcome Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) led by Nur Misuari as well as other factions to participate in the peace process.
The implementation of the peace agreement with the MILF largely depends on its political track since the Bangsamoro Basic Law, the supposed implementing mechanism of the CAB, failed to pass in the previous Congress during the precedency of Benigno Aquino III.
The security concerns over Southern Philippines has increased since the rise of IS, to which some militants including members of the terrorist terrorist Abu Sayyaf group had pleaded allegiance.
Speaking at the event on Saturday, Malaysian deputy defence minister Mohd Johari Baharom said a handful of Malaysians had sneaked into the Philippines to join Abu Sayyaf.
He said a successful peace process in the region would fend off the threat by IS.
For his part, MILF chairman Murad Ebrahim admitted that IS elements had penetrated the area, ""but we are confident that if the peace process succeed, IS will not get foothold"" in the region.

MANILA, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine court granted bail to detained leftist rebel leaders on Friday, paving the way for them to participate in the peace talks with the Philippine government later this month.
Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza welcomed the Manila Regional Trial Court's ruling to enable Benito and Wilma Tiamzon to attend the peace negotiations on Aug. 20-27 in Oslo, Norway, the third party facilitator in the peace talks.
""The couple occupies a strategic leadership role in the talks as high ranking leaders of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP),"" he said.

MANILA, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Three former Philippine comfort women, who were forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War ll, led a rally Friday in front of the Japanese Embassy in Manila to protest Japan's rising militarism.
""Japan is again making its presence felt in matters of security in the Asia Pacific,"" said Rechilda Extremadura, executive director of Lila Pilipina, an organization of Philippine comfort women.
""(The Japanese) government is again taking the militarist path after convincing the Japanese people and its victim-nations to erase in their collective memory Japan's World War II atrocities like wartime sexual slavery through the comfort women system,"" she said.
Extremadura told Xinhua that only three ageing victims participated in the protest rally, saying many of the victims are in their late 80s and 90s.
""Only a few number of World War II comfort women are left to express their alarm over Japan's rising militarism, but their commitment remains unwavering,"" Extremadura said.
She said the protest was an advance commemoration of the end of World War II which the organizers dubbed as International Memorial Day of Comfort Women on Aug. 14.
""The action also serves to call attention on their plight in time with the last day of visit in the Philippines of Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida,"" she said. Kishida is in the Philippines for a three-day visit that ended Friday.
During his visit, Kishida discussed with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay on a string of issues, including trade, economy and maritime security.
Extremadura said Japan was able to convince the South Korean government in December, ""through U.S. prodding, to give up its fight for comfort women by accepting 1 billion yen for comfort women in exchange for their silence.""
""Then, early this year, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made an explicit call for the amendment of Japan Constitution's Article 9 that prevents Japan from maintaining and building up its military force, saying it is inconsistent with the existence of its Self-Defense Force,"" she said.
Extremadura also said that Lila Pilipina remains in solidarity with other comfort women, especially from South Korea and called on South Korea to pursue justice for the victims of wartime sexual slavery by thwarting attempts by the U.S. and Japanese governments to silence them.
""They must not compromise justice in exchange for compensation. The comfort women's dignity, destroyed by the Japanese in World War II cannot be bought by one billion Yen. It can only be rebuilt by justice,"" she said.
Meanwhile, Extremadura said their group is looking forward to a dialogue with President Duterte to brief him on the plight of the Filipino women who were forced to work in Japanese wartime military brothels during the WWII.
Lila Pilipina (League of Filipino Women) has documented 174 comfort women who have gone public since early 1990s. Only 70 of them remain alive. Another group, the Malaya Lolas (Free Grandmothers), has documented 90 but the number dwindled to 33 following the death of the rest over the years.
Both groups are demanding an official apology, compensation, and inclusion of the comfort women issue in Japan's historical accounts and textbooks.
The Philippine government has intentionally avoided discussions of the issue at bilateral talks with Japan. Extremadura said they are hoping Duterte will raise the issue when he visits Japan.

MANILA, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Friday that he is willing to relax the foreign ownership restrictions in the constitution in a bid to lure more foreign investors and boost employment.
Duterte told a press conference in Davao City late Thursday night that he conveyed to visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida about his plan during their meeting in the southern Philippine city Thursday afternoon.
The 1987 Philippine constitution limits foreign ownership of companies in the Philippines to 40 percent, restricting the flow of foreign investments into the country and protecting the domestic monopolies from foreign competition in vital industries like ports, shipping, telecommunications, power and other infrastructure.
The constraint results in poor investment climate in the country, according to economists.
""I was before against selling the lands, I think that is still my stand, but I'm willing to change this 60-40 thing, make it more elaborate, maybe even a half-half thing as long as there are really a good investments where I can provide livelihoods for everybody,"" Duterte said.

The formal meeting to be held on August 13 to August 14 in Kuala Lumpur will be the first under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.
Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza said the scheduled meeting is crucial as the two sides are entering the implementation phase of the peace agreement.
""This (meeting) is actually to launch the implementation stage of what we envisioned to be a Bangsamoro enabling law. It is to implement the CAB that was signed between the government and the MILF in 2014,"" he said.
""We have already gotten the consensus of all sectors in the Bangsamoro that the period of the negotiations is over. We are now in the process of implementing all these signed agreements,"" he added.
Dureza said the meeting in Kuala Lumpur would zero-in on the mechanism that will determine how the new enabling law will be crafted, as well as to discuss key provisions in the CAB that can already be implemented, including the delivery of socio-economic development programs in Mindanao.
The implementation of the peace agreement with the MILF largely depends on its political track since the Bangsamoro Basic Law, the supposed implementing mechanism of the CAB, failed to pass in the previous Congress.

In a speech before soldiers in Samar province, Duterte lamented the dilly-dallying of communist rebels in responding to the government-initiated peace talks.
Duterte said he is getting exasperated by the rebels' indecision. However, he said ""still I would insist that we talk with or without Sison or with or without the politburo.""
To the communist rebels, Duterte said, ""We want peace but if I hear another landmine explosion then (we bid the peace talks) goodbye. I will order the peace panel to return to the Philippines. Don't waste your money there and talk nonsense.""
""I am not warning you. I'm not giving an ultimatum even. I'm just saying that if another landmine explodes which is prohibited by the Geneva Convention I will forego with the peace talks and forget about it,"" he warned.
The government and the communist rebels are scheduled to hold talks in Oslo, Norway on Aug. 20 to Aug. 27, in a fresh attempt to revive stalled talks to end decades-old communist insurgency.
But even before the formal talks resume, Duterte and Sison have engaged in off-and-on word war that started when Duterte lifted a unilateral ceasefire when the rebels failed to reciprocate.

 Philippine president congratulates Filipino weightlifter for bagging silver in Rio Olympics

"|"
MANILA, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte congratulated Monday the first female Filipino weightlifter who won silver medal in the Rio Olympic Games, ending the 20-year long medal drought for the country.
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the President is ""honoured and proud"" of Hidilyn Diaz.
""We extend our sincerest congratulations and celebrate the end of the medal drought,"" he said.
Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar said Diaz is the country's first Olympic medalist from war-torn southern Philippines.
Diaz hails from southern city of Zamboanga and took up weightlifting from a relative who taught her the sports.
""Hers is about overcoming shyness but for an inspired nation, her road to Rio is a journey of grit, patience and determination which ended a 20-year long medal drought for the Philippines,"" Andanar said.
The last time the Philippines won an Olympic medal was in 1996 when Mansueto Velasco bagged silver medal in boxing.

 Commentary: Ramos' China visit marks Manila's first step in right direction over South China Sea

"|"
by Wang Haiqing
BEIJING, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Monday starts a trip to China, after months of tension between the two countries as a result of Manila's headstrong arbitration quest on the South China Sea. Ramos' visit brings a whiff of hope that the two countries will return to bilateral negotiations over the issue.
Ramos is probably the best choice for the job of breaking ice since he is a revered statesman widely respected in his own country and in Asia. His long history of friendly exchanges with China also gives him a unique advantage in helping revive chilly bilateral ties.
China has long insisted that the South China Sea disputes be resolved via bilateral talks and that parties involved refrain from moves that could further complicate the issue.
However, the Aquino administration, in disregard of regional consensus and his country's previous agreements with China, pushed for an ill-founded arbitration case with regard to its disputes with China over the South China Sea.
The lengthy process, which culminated in an absurd ruling by an international tribunal on July 12, severely damaged not only the relations between China and the Philippines, but also the prospects of lasting peace in the vast body of waters surrounded by a number of Asian countries.
So it is really a relief that President Rodrigo Duterte, who was recently sworn in, chose to distance himself from the arbitration case and showed a series of positive gestures toward China.
That said, it is still worth mentioning that the Manila-initiated arbitration case is nothing more than an abuse of international law and the deeply biased ruling on the case should have no place whatsoever in future bilateral talks over the South China Sea issue between China and the Philippines.
Ramos' visit, which represents the first concrete step on the Philippine side to engage in bilateral talks with China on the South China Sea, could open a new chapter in settling disputes.
But a return to the normal track of settlement depends largely on the sincerity of the Philippines. Decision makers in Manila should know that the fragile relations with Beijing could hardly take another hit.

MANILA, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- The burial of late Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos at the country's heroes' cemetery will take place on Sept. 18, local media reported Saturday.
The daily newspaper, The Philippine Star, quoted Marcos's son as saying that the date has been agreed upon during the family's meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at the presidential palace earlier this week.
Senator Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. disclosed the details of the burial during lunch on Friday with selected editors of The Philippine Star.
The report quoted Marcos Jr. as saying the Marcoses have started preparations for the interment rites that include a 21-gun salute military honors.
Marcos Jr. also told the Philippine Star that he and his elder sister, Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos, have been coordinating with the Armed Forces of the Philippines that administers the heroes' cemetery.
The burial of Marcos in the heroes' cemetery has been a divisive issue in the Philippines.
But Duterte said he would allow the burial to ""erase hatred"" and initiate healing in the country.
""I will allow the burial of President marcos at the Libingan ng mag Bayan (heroes' cemetery) not because he is a hero but because he was a Filipino soldier. Period,"" Duterte told a news conference in May.
Marcos died in Hawaii in 1989. His body, which was brought back to the Philippines in 1993, is now on display inside a glass box in an air-conditioned crypt in the family's ancestral home in Laoag, north of Manila.

MANILA, Aug. 5 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) has imposed a record 1-billion-peso (21.3 million U.S. dollars) fine on Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., in connection with the Bangladesh Bank heist scandal, the central bank said in a statement Friday.
""The Monetary Board approved the imposition of supervisory enforcement action on RCBC to pay the amount of 1 billion pesos, in connection with the special examination conducted by the (central bank) relating to the Bangladesh Bank cyber heist,""the statement read.
""This affirms the (central bank's) strong commitment to ensure the stability of the country's financial system through strong and effective regulation of BSP-supervised financial institution (BSFI).""
The central bank said this is the largest amount it has ever imposed on a financial institution as part of its supervisory enforcement actions on a BSFIs.
The imposition of fine was in connection with the 81 million U.S. dollars stolen from a Bangladeshi central bank that made its way into the Philippines through RCBC employees. The government has managed to trace most of the 81 million U.S. dollars but at least 17 million U.S. dollars is still unaccounted for, prompting the Bangladesh to seek the help of President Rodrigo Duterte.

MANILA, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has significantly increased its illegal drugs' seizure, which amounted to 2.594 billion pesos (55 million U.S. dollars) during the first month of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, a senior government official said Thursday.
From July 1 to 31, the anti-narcotics agencies led by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) conducted 123 anti-drug operations, resulting in the arrest of 215 drug personalities and the seizure of dangerous drugs and controlled precursors and essential chemicals (CPECs).
""The 2.5 billion pesos seizure of illegal drugs was achieved only in a month's time, compared to the total estimated value of 2.86 billion pesos confiscated the entire year of 2015,""said PDEA Director General Isidro S. Lapena.
Out of the seized drug evidence, 180 kilograms of methamphetamine hydrochloride, or shabu, with an estimated market value of 900 million pesos, were dug up in northern province of Cagayan.
For the period, two clandestine laboratories used in the manufacture of shabu, and one storage facility were dismantled, Lapena said.
""The timeline has been set and the targets have been identified. PDEA and other partner agencies are working diligently to address the self-imposed obligations made by President Duterte to the Filipino people,""the PDEA chief said.
Duterte has promised to address crime, including illegal drugs, within the first three to six months of his administration.

MANILA, Aug. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine police are tracking down prank callers that have swamped the newly launched nationwide quick response hotlines that Filipinos can call during emergencies and report complaints, the police chief said Monday.
A few hours after the government activated emergency 911 and citizen complaint 8888 hotlines on Monday, Philippine National Police Director General Ronald de la Rosa said agents manning the hotlines received a total of almost 2,500 calls in the first seven hours.
However, De la Rosa said that only 75 of these calls were legitimate, while 1,119 were dropped calls and 304 were prank calls.
""We are currently tracking the prank callers,"" De la Rosa told a news conference at the police main headquarters Camp Crame. He vowed to ""unmask"" the false callers.
De la Rosa appealed to Filipinos ""to refrain from making prank calls or test calls"" to the emergency hotlines, saying this will ""clog up the lines and prevent the people with real emergencies to reach us.""
The hotlines were in line with President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign to stamp out crimes and corruption in government.
De la Rosa said policemen are the first responders for now, saying the 45-station strong call center can directly connect only to police units. He said it would be up to police responders to reach other emergency units.
The government hopes that eventually the 911 hotline will connect callers to police, fire, medical and other emergency units, De la Rosa said.

MANILA, Aug. 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday voiced hope that the peace talks with communist rebels will continue, stressing the need to usher in peace in the country.
""I hope that we can proceed with the talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP),"" Duterte said at the Malacanang presidential palace. he did not elaborate.
He also stressed the need to pursue peace talks not only with the communist rebels, but also with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front.
However, Duterte made it clear that his administration will not talk to the extremist Abu Sayyaf group, branding them as criminals.
""I will not deal wth criminals. I will not deal with persons of extreme brutality,"" he said, adding that ""there is no redeeming factor or reason for me to sit down and talk with criminals.""
""They (the Abu Sayyaf) are just out to derail the life of a nation,"" Duterte said. ""They have no ideology.""
Duterte revoked Saturday a week-old unilateral ceasefire he had declared after the communist rebels killed a militia man and wounded four others in Davao del Norte last Wednesday despite the truce.
The government and the communist rebels are scheduled to hold talks in Oslo, Norway from Aug. 20 to Aug. 27 in a fresh attempt to end decades-old leftist insurgency.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines said the CPP's armed wing - the New Peoples' Army has estimated 4,000 members. They have been fighting the government since 1969 in one of Asia's longest-running insurgencies.
The government has been attempting to forge peace with the rebels since 1986, but the on-and-off talks have faltered many times since.

MANILA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is still determined to pursue peace talks with the communist rebels despite the lifting of the unilateral ceasefire, Presidential Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza said on Sunday.
""It is very clear that the the president walked the extra mile for peace. And no doubt, he will still continue to do so at any given opportunity,""Dureza said in a statement.
He said that he would make recommendations during the cabinet meeting on Monday on how to move the talks forward.
The Communist Party of the Philippines announced Sunday its plan to declare a unilateral ceasefire next month as it urged the government to push through with the scheduled peace talks in Oslo, Norway on Aug. 20.
""To further support peace negotiations, the CPP is willing to issue a unilateral ceasefire declaration separately but simultaneously with the Duterte government on Aug. 20. The time-frame can be determined through negotiations,""the CPP said in a statement.
Dureza said in a statement Sunday that the CPP move, albeit delayed,""is a welcome development.""
""It affirms the value of the (Duterte's) firm actions for peace. This is what we have been waiting for,""Dureza said. The negotiating panels of both the government and the rebels are scheduled to resume formal talks in Oslo during August 20 to 27.
The CPP statement came almost a day after President Rodrigo Duterte revoked Saturday night a week-old truce with the communist rebels after the insurgents attacked militiamen in Davao del Norte that resulted in the death of a militia man.
Duterte demanded that the rebels also declare a truce as a result of the incident but the rebels failed to meet the 5 p.m. final deadline Duterte imposed Saturday.
In the wake of his order to lift the unilateral ceasefire, Duterte also ordered""all security forces to be on heightened alert"" and resumed their mandate""to neutralize all threats to national security.""
The CPP added""At this point, the CPP reiterates its full support for the resumption of the NDFP-GRP (National Democratic Front of the Philippines and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines) peace negotiations as a means of discussing the roots of the armed conflict.""
The CPP said ""it expects the Duterte government to make good its promise to release all peace consultants of NDFP as well as all political prisoners arrested and detained"" under the administrations of former Presidents Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Benigno Aquino.
""As earlier planned, the negotiations panels of the NDFP and the (government) can thereafter exchange these defalcations in order to discuss points for cooperation and coordination and determine ways of preventing armed skirmishes, misunderstandings and miscommunications during the course of the peace talks,""the CPP said.
Both the government and the communist rebels have expressed optimism that formal peace talks to end the decades-old communist insurgency will push trough in spite of President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to trash a week-old truce, saying they are looking forward to the Aug. 20 Oslo meeting.

MANILA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military and police have ordered their respective troops to be on high alert and work to neutralize all threats to national security after President Rodrigo Duterte lifted the unilateral declaration of ceasefire with the leftist rebels.
Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff General Ricardo Visaya said Sunday the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) has missed ""a golden opportunity"" to manifest its commitment to the attainment of peace.
He said Duterte's earlier declaration of unilateral truce could have silenced the guns and hastened development, especially in the countryside.
The leftist rebel leadership did not meet the ultimatum issued by Duterte that it declared its own truce until 5:00 p.m. local time on Saturday.
The president made the ultimatum after the NPA rebels attacked a group of militiamen on July 27 in northern province of Davao del Norte, killing one and wounding four others.
He became irked that the ambush took place even if he already declared a truce on July 25 during his first State of the Nation Address.
He said the rebels failed to show good faith.
""I am ordering all our forces to resume their normal mandated tasks and work to neutralize all threats to national security, protect the citizenry, enforce the laws and maintain peace in the land,"" Visaya said.
PNP Director General Ronald Dela Rosa also issued a separate memorandum to the policemen nationwide withdrawing the suspension of offensive police operation against the rebels.
He directed the law enforcers to be on high alert.
Peace adviser Jesus Dureza, meanwhile, said that with what transpired from July 25 until July 30 when the CPP-NPA-NDF leaders failed to reciprocate the truce, ""it is very clear that the president walked the extra mile for peace.""
""And no doubt, he will still continue to do so at any given opportunity,"" he said.
Dureza said that during the cabinet meeting on Monday, he would make ""corresponding recommendations"" regarding the peace process with the CPP-NPA-NDF.

Two Abu Sayyaf members were killed in a firefight with soldiers from the Joint Task Force Basilan at Hill 490, barangay Poblacion in Tipo-tipo town in Basilan, said Filemon Tan, spokesman of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)' Western Mindanao Command.
Tan said the troops were on a security operation when they caught up with undetermined number of Abu Sayyaf Group members at around 6:30 a.m. local time.
The firefight left nine soldiers injured, who were later airlifted to Camp Navarro General Station in Zamboanga City.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that shelling and air strikes over the last three weeks have forced 3,400 families from three towns of Tipo-tipo, Al-Barka and Ungkaya Pukan to leave their houses and farms.
The residents are now living with their relatives in nearby towns that are not yet affected by the military offensives, the statement said.

""We urge all to the fighting to exercise utmost precaution to minimize the impact or damage to civilian communities,"" said Fridez, pleading to the clashing groups ""to spare the civilian structures such as hospitals, schools and houses, and facilities that are essential for their daily lives.""
Fridez said the ICRC, together with volunteers from the Philippine Red Cross, has visited evacuees in the three affected municipalities this week to distribute hygiene kits, blankets, towels jerry cans, mosquito nets and sleeping mats.
The ICRC also distributed dressing kits and medical supplies including drugs and anti-tetanus vaccines to enhance the capacity of the rural health units in the three towns to treat the sick and wounded, he said.
In April, he said the ICRC and the Department of Health Emergency Management Bureau had conducted Basic Life Support training for 168 health staff in Basilan and nearby Sulu provinces.

BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The great expenses for the South China Sea arbitration unilaterally initiated by the former Philippine government should be made public, as some Filipinos are already questioning the source of the money.
In 2013, the Benigno Aquino III administration unilaterally filed a case on the South China Sea dispute between the Philippines and China. An ad hoc arbitral tribunal set up at Manila's request issued a highly controversial and biased award on July 12, denying China's long-standing historic rights in the South China Sea.
Questions about how much money has been spent on the arbitration, paid by whom and to whom, have not only sparked hot debates in the Philippines, but also drawn attention worldwide.
It had cost Manila 30 million U.S. dollars to merely pay off legal fees and expenses of lawyers who prepared the case against China, Rigoberto Tiglao, former spokesperson and head of presidential office for former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, wrote in an article published in mid-July by the Manila Times.
This prompted a question, raised openly three days later by former senator Francisco S. Tatad, about the real cost of the arbitration. He suspected that the former Philippine government hid the truth from its nationals.
The government ""never told the public how much the arbitration would cost the Filipino taxpayers. The Constitution provides that no money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law, yet no appropriation has been disclosed for this particular purpose,"" he wrote to the Manila Times.
""How much then is it? Are any foreign donors involved?"" he asked.
""The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency or its State Department should reimburse us,"" said Tiglao, suggesting that the arbitration case provides an excuse for the United States to interfere in the South China Sea.
Looking back, The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) charged the arbitral tribunal for the South China Sea case 2.85 million euros (3.16 million dollars ) for the secretarial service.
This was a sum all paid by Manila, including the share supposed to have been borne by Beijing, which had insisted on a stance of non-acceptance of and non-participation in the arbitration.
This cost is supposed to cover human labor and rents for office and office equipment, as well as possible payments to the five members of the arbitral tribunal, said Wang Hanling, a Chinese maritime law expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
A gross sum of partial expenses can be traced on the basis of open data, Wang said. For instance, charges of secretarial service include openly-priced human labor, a single payment of 2,000 euros (2,218 dollars) for registration, and daily rent of office equipment at 1,750 euros (1,940 dollars), among other things, and the hearings room is charged at 1,000 euros (1,109 dollars) per day.
""Such estimations can lead to a conclusion that the arbitrators pocketed largely the money Manila paid,"" Wang wrote in an article published on July 28 in China's Global Times newspaper.
The PCA charges are the only part made public of the expenses of the arbitration case, Wang said.
Setting a rare precedent in the history of international justice and arbitration by sweepingly siding with Manila's claims, the arbitral award has been widely questioned and challenged in the world. What's worse, it indicates something fishy about the arbitrators, Wang said.
Wang believes that certain countries such as the United States and Japan, and some organizations, probably have invested a great deal of money and resources in the South China Sea arbitration case, citing the first payment by some U.S. institutions.
However, what Manila finally gained from the arbitration case is nothing but a scrap of paper, instead of benefits, he said.
In this regard, it is necessary for Manila to open the records of expenses for the arbitration, so as to respond to the questions raise by the Philippine people and address the concerns of the international community, Wang concluded.

MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is targeting to allocate 3 billion Philippine Pesos (63.67 million U.S. dollars) next year for the full implementation of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 to help address unexpected pregnancies, especially among the teens, government chief economist said Thursday.
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia told the foreign press that of about 10 million Filipino girls with ages between 15 to 19, about a million of them became pregnant.
He said the future mostly of those who got pregnant ""is shut"" because they discontinued schooling.
He said the government has to ""speedily and fully implement"" the reproductive health law.
The proposed budget for the law in 2017 will be higher from the current budget of about 2 billion pesos, Pernia said.
Part of the plan is to have a massive information campaign about sexuality, especially among the youth, and the distribution of contraceptives, he said.

""I want to hear from MI(LF) and MN(LF) that they have no connection anymore with the Abu Sayyaf because the arms of the Abu Sayyaf belong to them,"" he said in a speech in northern province of Nueva Ecija in front of the government troops.
Duterte said there would be ""no significant result"" in the talks if the MILF and the MNLF would not cut their ties with the Abu Sayyaf whom he ordered to be crushed by the military during his first State of the Nation Address on Monday.
He even promised to provide a safe conduct pass to former MNLF leader Nur Misuari, who has been in hiding for instigating rogue MNLF members to take arms in southern city of Zamboanga three years ago, so that he can participate in the talks.
While the Philippines has signed separate peace agreements with the MNLF and the MILF, they continue to press the government for the implementation of the deals.

MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will become the first president from Mindanao to deliver a State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday.
Communications secretary Martin Andanar said on Sunday that the speech, which is expected to be delivered in English, has been written mostly by the president himself and had already undergone more than 10 revisions.
He said the speech, which he described as ""powerful,"" will run for about 38 minutes.
The tradition of the delivering a SONA in the country started in 1935 when then president Manuel Quezon addressed a special session of the National Assembly on November 25, 1935.
While first Philippine President Emilio Aguinaldo delivered a speech during the Inaugural Session of the Assembly of Representatives or the Malolos Congress in Sept. 15, 1898, it was not considered a SONA but a congratulatory message to the Assembly.
The SONA, after only being enshrined in the 1935 Philippine Constitution, became an annual practice since the Commonwealth of the Philippines.
Since then, as stated under the 1935 Constitution, the delivery of a SONA became a constitutional obligation and yearly tradition where president reports on the status of the country, unveils the government's agenda for the coming year, and proposes to Congress certain legislative measures.
The delivery of the SONA is made by the president in the presence of a joint Congress and is usually delivered in the Session Hall of the House of Representatives.
A briefer prepared by the Official Gazette said a total of 76 SONA have already been delivered since then and Duterte's address tomorrow will be the 77th.
There were at least four years when the annual SONA was not delivered which happened during the World War II or Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1944, and in 1986 after the first Edsa People Power Revolution.

c_135535820.htm|2016-07-24| Commentary: East Asia needs partners, not meddlers|"

by Xinhua Writer Liu Chang
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific boasts the world's most dynamic economies, highly lucrative markets and captivating cultural diversity. It could well become the future of the world. Yet some meddlers are jeopardizing that prospect.
Starting from Sunday, foreign ministers of the East Asia Summit countries will be under the same roof in the Laotian capital of Vientiane for a series of meetings. The coming days are a chance for the top diplomats to start engaging in damage control after the recent null and void award on the South China Sea arbitration, a blow to peace and stability in the region.
Worryingly, the arbitration, a unilateral move by the Philippines, has set a fraught and dangerous precedent of mishandling maritime disputes. Worse still, a handful of countries within and outside the region have urged China to follow the ruling by a highly questionable arbitral tribunal in The Hague, which has clearly acted beyond its jurisdiction. The ruling by no means helps solving the problem by peaceful ways and only serves to increase the likelihood of confrontation and turbulence.
In a latest positive sign, former Philippine President Fidel Ramos has accepted the offer of President Rodrigo Duterte to be special envoy to China, opening the possibility of dialogue between Beijing and Manila. It is a testimony that the South China Sea disputes can be solved by directly involved parties, without the interference from outsiders.
Still, the risks of rising tensions, fanned by a few countries may not be underestimated.
Despite Washington's denial, it clearly has a hand in this. During the past eight years, the Obama administration has mostly seen China as a potential challenger to its ""leadership"" in the region and has been seeking to curb its rise with its iconic ""Pivot to Asia"" policy.
By excluding China, the world's second-largest economy, from the Trans-Pacific Pact, Washington tries to be the only one who wears the pants in the region.
Meanwhile, the United States has left no stone unturned to sow discord between China and its neighbors. In the South China Sea, the United States paints China as a threat to freedom of navigation and accuses it of weaponizing the area. On the Korean Peninsula, it, under the pretext of deterring the missile menace from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has managed to get the Blue House to okay its deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea. As the U.S. surveillance range penetrates deep into Chinese territories, tensions between Beijing and Seoul are flaring.
Japan is also good at muddying the waters. Tokyo tries to pressure Beijing on the South China Sea front, hoping that China will not be resourceful enough to handle the island contention in the East China Sea simultaneously. However, this tactic of distraction will not pay off given China's determination and capability to defend its territorial integrity.
The firebrands need to be careful of what they wish for. Their strategy of fanning China-phobia is only going to instigate distrust and disorder, and invite recession to the region, while their own security and economic interests will suffer heavy setbacks.
As for the East Asian nations, they have to stay vigilant about the U.S. foray into the region, and should refuse to be used as pawns in Washington's geopolitical board game. One would believe that the leaders of these nations would be wise enough to at least learn some lessons from the disgraceful Iraqi war and the following bloody interference in Libya and Syria that have turned almost the entire Middle East upside down and fostered the emergence of global terrorism's new standard-bearer, the Islamic State group.
Right now, the global economic recovery is still weak and unbalanced, while Asia's economies are also facing serious challenges. To get out of the economic wilderness, the East Asian nations need to forge even stronger partnerships, and turn away from ill-intentioned troublemakers.
China is the top trading partner of many East Asian nations, including most of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations members, while their past economic transactions have proved mutually rewarding.
As Beijing is getting ready to promote its Belt and Road Initiative, its neighbors would reap far more tangible benefits if they choose to broaden their cooperation with China, a market no country can afford to lose.

MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte continues to enjoy the trust of ""overwhelming majority"" of Filipinos, a survey said Wednesday.
Pulse Asia Research Inc. said in its latest survey that 91 percent of the 1,200 Filipinos interviewed nationwide expressed their trust to Duterte. Only 0.2 percent of the respondents distrust the new Philippine president, the survey said.
The survey polled 1,200 Filipinos from July 2 to 8.
""President Duterte begins his stint as the country's 16th president with an overwhelming majority of his constituents expressing trust in him and practically no one distrusting him,"" the survey said.
""The rest of Filipinos (8 percent) cannot say if they trust or distrust Duterte,"" according to the survey.
The survey also showed that Filipinos want the Duterte administration to control the prices of commodities, create more jobs and craft new pro-poor programs in its first six months in office.
It added that 48 percent of Filipino surveyed would like the Duterte administration to address the problem of criminality immediately.
Other issues that Filipinos want Duterte to address are granting of loans to small entrepreneurs and the self-employed, the preparation of a program addressing the government's debt problem, and the continued pursuit of peace negotiations with different armed groups.
Duterte assumed presidency on June 30.

SINGAPORE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Qizheng, dean of the school of journalism at the Renmin University of China, said here Tuesday that it is hoped that China and the Philippines could restart bilateral negotiations, and the negotiations should move step by step.
Zhao, who is also former minister of China's State Council Information Office, made the remarks at the media briefing after the Think Tank Seminar on South China Sea and Regional Cooperation and Development held here on Monday.
Highlighting that China and the Philippines share lots of common interests, Zhao said that there are also contradictions and conflicts both countries face.
The conflict between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea has been decades, and the problem is difficult to solve in the near future, Zhao said, adding that the best way is to start with problems that are easy to reach agreements, before moving to more complex issues.
""China and Philippines can temporarily put aside differences, and discuss issues of joint exploration first,""Zhao said.
""Joint developments are very broad, including resources, fisheries, maritime rescue, meteorologic data exchange as well as disaster relief at sea. We should move step by step.""
Li Guoqiang, deputy director of the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), said that China's door to dialogue has always been open, and bilateral negotiations and peaceful settlement of disputes are always welcomed.
The government of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III filed the arbitration against China in 2013, despite the agreement his country had reached with China on resolving disputes in the South China Sea through bilateral negotiations. Since then, China-Philippines relations have been severely deteriorated.
However, current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has expressed readiness and willingness to hold bilateral talks with China, saying that he is planning to send envoy to China to restart negotiations.
Li said that he hopes the South China Sea issue would be properly re-pulled back on the track of diplomatic negotiations on the basis of mutual respect and joint consultation.
He stressed that if China and Philippines decide to restart diplomatic mechanism, under no circumstances should the South China Sea arbitration be used as reference.
Organized by the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the one-day seminar attracted more than 20 experts from academic institutes in China and Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia.

 Philippines to raise allowances for athletes to Rio Olympics

"|"
MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday announced that he is more than doubling the allowances of the members of the Philippine delegation to Rio for the Summer Olympics as he urged them to do their best in each competition where they are representing the country.
Duterte, during a send-off ceremony for the Philippine delegation, said he is raising the allowances of the athletes, coaches and members of the secretariat from 1,000 U.S. dollars to 3,000 U.S. dollars and of the officials from 2,000 U.S. dollars to 5,000 U.S. dollars.
""One thousand (dollars), if I were you, I would not go there,"" Duterte joked before announcing that he is raising the allowances.
He urged the athletes to do their best regardless of the challenges that they will face in the Olympics, adding that the country is sending athletes to Rio where the country is likely to excel the most.
He told the athletes that they should just bear in mind that it is an honor to serve the country and that not everyone can do so.
Duterte said it is sad that the country does not have enough funds to finance the development of a person as an athlete nor to establish facilities and structure that can help the athletes improve in their disciplines, but he promised that he will try to do something to help uplift athletes in the country.
Philippine Sports Commission Chairman William Ramirez and Philippine Olympic Committee President Jose Cojuancgo Jr. both thanked Duterte for accommodating the delegation in Malacanang Presidential Palace and for showing his support for the team.
Cojuancgo said Duterte's support may be the inspiration that the Philippine team, especially the athletes, need to boost the morale.

SINGAPORE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The ad-hoc arbitral tribunal lost its own face in the South China Sea arbitration with the lack of political wisdom, and countries would return to negotiations to solve disputes, an Indian expert said here Monday.
Swaran Singh, professor at School of International Studies of Jawaharlal Nehru University in India, said the arbitration unilateral initiated by the Philippines is not a victory even for the Philippines itself, as the newly inaugurated president Rodrigo Duterte had shown little trust in the arbitration.
""If the Philippines doesn't believe it, it will have a very limited role to play,"" he said.
The Chinese government said the ad hoc arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction over relevant submissions, and awards rendered by it are null and void and have no binding force.
Speaking to reporters during a think tank seminar on South China Sea and regional cooperation and development, Singh said the arbitral tribunal lacked political wisdom by not seeking a resolution on the ground.
""The fundamental principle of arbitration is that both parties should submit the case for arbitration, should participate in the arbitration, should give undertakings that the binding outcome will be acceptable to them, which are missing in this case,"" he said.
""So I think the casualty here is arbitration itself. The trust of people in international relations in arbitration being a solution has been really hit badly by this.""

 Interview: Resumption of negotiations between China, Philippines will set example for region: Singapore expert

"|"
By Ma Yujie, Lin Hao
SINGAPORE, July 18 (Xinhua)-- China and the Philippines can set a good example to other Southeast Asian countries in coping with disputes over the South China Sea, if both sides resume bilateral negotiations and aim for pragmatic, positive results, said Dr. Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University.
Oh made the remarks in an exclusive interview with Xinhua during the Think Tank Seminar on South China Sea and Regional Cooperation and Development, which is being held here on Monday.
The government of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III filed the arbitration against China in 2013, despite the agreement his country had reached with China on resolving their disputes in the South China Sea through bilateral negotiations.
An ad hoc tribunal handling the South China Sea arbitration issued its final ruling on July 12, sweepingly siding with Manila's cunningly packaged claims, denying China's long-standing historical rights in the South China Sea and claiming China has no sovereign right on some atolls in the region.
In response, China has reaffirmed its unwavering position of non-acceptance and non-recognition of the award, adding that the South China Sea issue should be solved through bilateral negotiations by relevant parties on the basis of historical facts and in accordance with international law, as well as the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC).
Unlike its predecessor, the current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has expressed his readiness and willingness to hold bilateral talks with China. He has also said that both countries can work together to jointly develop the South China Sea.
Oh said that both countries expressing their willingness to talks shows that they're not too concerned about the arbitration result, but put more focused on returning to the negotiation table. This in itself is of far more significance than the arbitration, added Oh.
""Bilateral relations between China and the Philippines reached a new low point after Aquino III filed the arbitration, if under such circumstances, the two could resume bilateral negotiations and achieve positive, pragmatic agreements, it would definitely set a good example for other Southeast Asian countries in dealing with disputes over the South China Sea,""Oh said.
Oh went on to say that China and the Philippines, as well as other countries in the region, can work together in areas include fisheries cooperation, anti-terrorism information exchange, joint exploration and development of resources in the South China Sea, as well as disaster relief, which are also in line with the interests and needs of ASEAN countries.
""Countries in the region generally hope to see the South China Sea resources developed in order to assist their economic growth, and China can make use of its own funds and technical advantages, and propose win-win, sustainable development strategies to jointly explore these resources.""
""This can help build a deeper and wider friendship with neighboring countries, reaching the ultimate goal of mutual benefits,""the doctor maintained.
Organized by the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the seminar attracted more than 20 experts from academic institutes in China and Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia.

 Commentary: Concrete actions from new Philippine gov't key to break ice, solve disputes

"|"
by Fei Liena
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- To clear the waters of the South China Sea which has been muddied by the arbitration case initiated by the former Philippine government, the new government needs to take concrete actions than just nice words.
In his latest gesture to break the ice of bilateral relations with China caused by the ridiculous ""award,"" new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday that he was asking former President Fidel Ramos to help start talks with China over disputes in the South China Sea, taking a first concrete and constructive step to really solve the disputes with China.
Since Duterte took office on June 30, he has released a series of positive signals, trying to warm up the chilly relations with China. He said he does not want to go to war with China and that he is not interested in letting his country join America's ""free navigation"" action.
Duterte's gestures have given people a bit of confidence that the new Philippine government is trying to clean up the mess left over by his predecessor Benigno S. Aquino III, and bring relations with China back to the right track.
The invalid arbitration over the South China Sea, along with the subsequent political manipulation and Western media hoo-ha, has set a bad example of abusing international law and brought the issue to a dangerous and confrontational situation.
The current tension does no good to the China-Philippine relations, as well as the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. Bringing the disputes back to the right track of solution would serve the interests of both parties.
The Chinese leadership said Tuesday that China is ready to resolve disputes peacefully through negotiation and consultation with those states directly concerned. China will make every effort to seek win-win results and maintain the peace that is so vital to stability and prosperity in the region.
China and the Philippines are neighbors. The bilateral disputes are basically disagreements in the neighborhood, and can be solved through talks by the neighbors.
People expect the new Philippine government to show its sincerity with more concrete actions, and work with the Chinese side to properly manage and contain disagreements, so as to push bilateral relations back to its proper place.
Only by sealing a deal through equal negotiation among parties directly concerned can relevant disputes be fundamentally resolved, and the deal be effectively implemented.
Instead of being troubled waters, the South China Sea serves as a bridge connecting China and its neighbors. Maintaining the peace, stability and prosperity of the South China Sea is the common wish and responsibility of China and ASEAN members, and serves the interests of those countries.
As long as the parties insist on solving disagreements through negotiation and consultation and seeking win-win cooperation, the South China Sea will basically be a sea of peace and prosperity.

for both sides"|"

BRUSSELS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Long-lasting solutions to the
South China Sea dispute between China and the Philippines must be
acceptable for both sides, and could only be reached through
bilateral dialogues, a Czech member of the European Parliament
(MEP) said Thursday.

""I think that the nature of the South China Sea dispute is very
complex and a single ruling cannot be all-encompassing,"" Miroslav
Poche, also a member of the European Parliament's delegation for
relations with China, told Xinhua.

The arbitration was unilaterally initiated in 2013 by the former
Philippine government and its award was issued on Tuesday,
sweepingly siding with Manila's cunningly packaged claims.

China has refused to participate in the proceedings, reiterating
its stance that it neither accepts nor recognizes the award.

Poche said former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III's
decision to file the case to an arbitral tribunal has provided no
help to the dispute, but undermined international law.

""I believe one of the important aspects of international law is
the respectable role of international institutions which play a
role and help all sides to find a solution,"" he said.

""In my opinion, acceptable solutions to such a dispute should
respect human principle,"" Poche said. ""First, it has to be based on
the whole body of international law; second, only a peaceful means
that is used to achieve a final settlement can be accepted.""

He pointed out that the dispute between China and the
Philippines is a bilateral issue, which can only be solved through
direct dialogue and consultation, adding that ""it is necessary at
the same time that there are no superpowers involved in any
solution to the problem.""

Noting that involvement from the United States and other
countries outside the region may add imbalance to the situation,
Poche suggested the European Union (EU) not to interfere.

He added that the international community including the EU
should encourage both China and the Philippines to engage in direct
negotiation as soon as possible.

""We all appreciate that both sides tend for a peaceful solution.
The international community can facilitate hopes for the process
instead of being arbitrary,"" he said.

that he is asking former President Fidel Ramos to help start talks

""The Philippines shall continue to engage concerned parties to finding ways to reduce regional tensions and to build greater trust and confidence. In this regard, the Philippines will continue fostering mutually beneficial relations with all nations,"" he said.
He added: ""Trust and confidence go hand in hand with mutual respect and equal partnership, two of ASEM's (Asia-Europe Meeting) core values. For twenty years we have all worked under these guiding principles. I am confident that we shall continue to do so in the years ahead.""
The arbitral tribunal issued the ruling Tuesday on the case unilaterally initiated by the Philippines against China regarding their disputes in the South China Sea.
The Chinese government on Wednesday issued a white paper titled ""China Adheres to the Position of Settling Through Negotiation the Relevant Disputes Between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea.""
""The Arbitral Tribunal established at the Philippines' unilateral request has no jurisdiction over relevant submissions, and awards rendered by it are null and void and have no binding force,"" said the document.

SANSHA, Hainan, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An emergency drill involving 13 ships and a helicopter was held Thursday morning at seas near Sansha in southern China's island province of Hainan, the city's marine bureau said.
It is the first comprehensive emergency drill on such large scale after Sansha was established in 2012. The drill included air-sea search and rescue, emergency treatment and sea fire-fighting.
Two cargo ships ""collided"" near Sansha and left seven mariners missing. Fire broke out on one of the ships, threatening the lives of eight other sailors onboard.
Upon receiving the SOS, the city's maritime search and rescue center initiated an emergency plan, dispatching cruise, salvage and coast guard ships near the area to search for the missing sailors and put out the fire.
Over 200 people from 10 departments participated in the drill. The seven mariners were saved and the fire extinguished, according to the bureau.
The maritime search and rescue center in Sansha was established in July, 2013, and has since rescued 1,201 people in 49 emergencies.
According to deputy mayor Chen Rumao, the city plans to normalize such emergency drills and expand their area into Nansha waters.

 UNCLOS has no jurisdiction over territorial issues: S. African commentator

"|"

JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has no jurisdiction over territorial issues and maritime delimitation, a well-known South African commentator wrote in The Star newspaper on Thursday.
The West sees the South China Sea arbitration as an important crossroads in China's rise as a global power, but there are misperceptions, Shannon Ebrahim wrote in the commentary titled ""How West misperceives and misconceives Chinese politics.""
""It is not; it has already risen. China is actually 10 steps ahead of the West in most cases, and Shanghai makes New York look like the old world,"" she said.
One mistake the West has made is to view the arbitral tribunal on the South China Sea issue as a legitimate process in international law, but there was no legal basis for the tribunal to begin with, Ebrahim said.
The compulsory arbitration was unilaterally initiated in 2013 by the administration of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III, whose term ended on June 30. It issued an award on July 12 that sweepingly sides with Manila's claims.
The arbitration was not only outside the jurisdiction of UNCLOS, Ebrahim wrote in the popular South African newspaper, ""it also disregarded the preference of China for direct negotiations and consultations with the Philippines.""
The new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has indicated a readiness to discuss with China about the South China Sea issue.
""This leaves open the possibility of negotiations, which China has always called for, China will not, however, accept the tribunal's ruling as the basis for settling the dispute,"" Ebrahim said.
""The Western media is used to rallying around a cause without dissecting the credibility of that cause, and this is one such instance where the Western media has arguably been on the wrong side of history,"" she said.
The Washington Post has carried frequent headlines suggesting that China intends turning the South China Sea into an internal lake or a Chinese lake, without providing any proof to back up such claims.
""The intended effect was to create the impression that China is the aggressor and not prepared to operate within the confines of international law,"" Ebrahim said.
She also noted that the reality of the situation is that the arbitral tribunal has no mechanism for enforcing its decision, and China will do exactly as it has stated all along -- simply ignore its findings.
In 1986, the United States ignored a ruling from the International Court of Justice that declared its mining in the harbors of Nicaragua illegal.
Washington is not a UNCLOS member. This leaves it with little credibility in terms of commenting on matters regarding adherence to UNCLOS.
""It is an even greater double standard for the U.S. to have provided the rear guard support to the Philippines to unilaterally initiate the arbitration,"" Ebrahim said, adding that the arbitration is itself in violation of UNCLOS.

The president, during a testimonial dinner hosted by the San Beda College, reiterated that war was not an option and he wanted to pursue peaceful solutions to the maritime disputes with China like bilateral talks.
He said he would still consult Ramos about it and eventually asked him to ""go to China to start the talks.""
The announcement came after an arbitral tribunal in The Hague issued an award Tuesday on an arbitration case unilaterally initiated by the Philippines against China regarding their disputes in the South China Sea.
Dismissing the ruling ""null and void with no binding force,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it will not accept any proposition or action based on the award.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said China will continue to endeavor to peacefully resolve disputes in the South China Sea with parties directly concerned through negotiation and consultation on the basis of respecting historical facts and in accordance with international law.
Ramos, who was the Philippine president from 1992 to 1998, acknowledged Duterte's decision, but did not say if he would accept the president's request.
Duterte earned his law degree from San Beda while Ramos is an honorary alumus of the San Beda College of Law.
Earlier in the day, Duterte was reportedly ready to start direct talks with China on the South China Sea disputes.

MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Three Marine soldiers were killed when they were ambushed by a group of Abu Sayyaf Group members in south Philippine province of Sulu on Thursday, said local authorities.
Filemon Tan, spokesperson of the military's Western Mindanao Command, said the soldiers were assigned with the Marine Battalion Landing Team 10. He declined to name the killed and said notification of their families is still pending.
Citing initial reports from ground units, Tan said the three soldiers were procuring supplies in Indanan town at around 8 a.m when they were waylaid by the undetermined number of suspects.
He said the soldiers were on foot at that time and were not able to fire back at the Abu Sayyaf attackers.
Tan said the bodies of the slain troops were brought to the Camp Teodulfo Bautista in Jolo town.
Government soldiers have intensified operations against the Abu Sayyaf Group in Sulu and Basilan in the wake of President Rodrigo Duterte's pledge to wipe out the group.
The Philippine government has been fighting the Abu Sayyaf rebels since the 1990s. Past administrations have labeled the group, numbering about 400, as bandits or criminals that carries out illegal activities including kidnappings for ransom, killings and bombings in Mindanao in southern Philippines.

c_135510617.htm|2016-07-13| Spotlight: Former Philippine officials urge gov't to talk with China bilaterally, ignore arbitral ruling|"
by Wang Wen, Yang Tianmu
MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine senior government officials Wednesday called on the Duterte administration to start bilateral talks with China immediately while ignoring the award issued by an ad hoc arbitral tribunal on the South China Sea issue Tuesday.
""The negotiation must start immediately. And the arbitral ruling is both useless and irrelevant,"" said Valdes, former undersecretary of Philippine Department of Education.
Valdes questioned the validity of the award which claims Taiping Island as a rock despite the fact that the island has an airstrip, a hospital, several buildings and fresh water.
""There is something wrong with the so called arbitration court,"" he said.
For Alberto Encomienda, former secretary-general of the Maritime and Ocean Affairs Center of the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department, the Philippines should not have taken the case to the tribunal in the first place.
He agrees with Valdes that the two governments should start to reconnect and talk bilaterally to solve the disputes as soon as possible.
In addition, the maritime expert believed ""if judged objectively, the ruling cannot be a leverage for the Philippines.""
""Let's begin from the beginning, rewind the clock, and go into consultations leading to negotiations and at the same time we work on joint development.""
They have also voiced concern over the U.S. intervention into this regional issue.
""The U.S. has been intervening too much in this region, even including on the matter of arbitration,"" said Encomienda.
When asked whether PCA's award will intensify conflict or even confrontation in the region, Encomienda said, ""if left to the two of us (China and the Philippines), the ruling should not intensify anything.""
According to him, that's because right after the arbitral ruling came down, China issued a statement saying it adheres to the position of settling the issue through negotiation. And on the Philippine side, President Duterte said earlier that he did not want any war.
""However, if there is U.S. intervention in the region, that's a different story,"" he added.
Encomienda further pointed out that if China and the Philippines start bilateral talks, the whole ASEAN will be more willing to cooperate on the South China Sea issue, which is not a situation that the U.S. wants to see.

It said the bank also committed to help the Duterte administration in promoting rural development and value chains, invest in human capital such as health and education and strengthen social protection including through conditional cash transfers.
""High priority will be given to supporting peace and development in Mindanao via road infrastructure rehabilitation, promotion of small-and-medium-sized enterprises, and local government capacity building,"" the statement read.
It added, ""ADB is collaborating with the Mindanao Development Authority, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and the Bangsamoro Development Agency, and other stakeholders.""
In the first half of 2016, the statement said ADB approved loans for the Philippines amounting to 583 million U.S. dollars for conditional cash transfers, water transmission improvement to Metro Manila and the vicinity, and water supply development in various municipalities.
""ADB is preparing 770 million U.S. dollars in additional loans for the rest of the year, related to youth employment, local government financial management, and road improvement in Mindanao,"" the statement said.
Based on further discussions with the new administration, it said ADB is ready to make additional increase to assistance in the coming years.
""ADB will also look for opportunities to increase its non-sovereign operations like loans, equity investment, and guarantees to the private sector,"" it said.
Nakao ""commended Duterte's early efforts to consult the private sector, civil society, and other partners to ensure level playing for all businesses, and uplift the lives of poor Filipinos, a fourth of the country's population.
""I was very impressed with President Duterte's clear messages on building confidence on public service delivery, respecting contracts and transactions already approved and awaiting implementation, removing red tape, and fighting corruption,"" Nakao said.

 Commentary: Will the Philippines now walk the talk?

"|"
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- ""Let those who tied the bell on to the tiger be the ones to untie it,"" runs the Chinese proverb: Trouble is best solved by those who caused it.
Whatever the government of the Philippines was thinking when it decided to put its disputes with China before a kangaroo court, it was surely not that the process would bring peace and harmony to a tranquil tropical sea.
China has stated time and time again that it would not accept the tribunal's opinion and will adhere to settlement of disputes through direct negotiation. That policy stands still, like a rock.
As neighbors facing each other across the sea, China and the Philippines have been friends for generations. There were no territorial disputes between them until the 1970s, when the Philippines suddenly decided that some of China's islands and reefs were in fact theirs and occupied them without so much as a by-your-leave. China's reaction to this affront has been restrained, to say the least. It is not too great a leap of understanding to conclude that China is the encroached upon rather than the encroacher.
In 2013, the government of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III ignored previous agreements with China and went running to The Hague. Aquino has since become a figure of purely historical relevance, and the job of cleaning up his mess has fallen to the new Philippine President, Rodrigo Duterte, who seems ready and willing to talk directly with China.
Even after the absurd arbitration award, China retains its faith in a peaceful solution and would welcome direct talks over the negotiating table.
A statement issued by the Chinese leadership on Tuesday said that China is still ready to resolve disputes peacefully through negotiation and consultation with those states directly concerned. China will make every effort to seek win-win results and maintain the peace that is so vital to stability and prosperity in the region.
Bringing the issue back to the negotiation table, and thereafter to a long-term solution, is in the interests of all parties, and is now down to the Philippines. President Duterte has begun to make positive gestures, but is his country ready to walk his talk?
China has said that the door is always open, but will not welcome any unreasonable demands nor sit idly by if deliberately provoked.
China will now decide whether to declare an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the South China Sea in accordance with the extent of a threat. ""If our security were threatened, of course we have the right,"" Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin told the press.
Chinese people do not make trouble, but are not cowards when trouble is made for them. Whether the South China Sea becomes a troublesome tempest of confrontation or the peaceful waters of cooperation and common prosperity is up to the Philippines and its friends.
Is it not better to remain friends with a good neighbor than to allow some faraway superpower to stir up conflicts at the doorstep? The destiny of the Philippines is in its own hands.

 China says ADIZ in South China Sea depends on threat

"|"
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China said on Wednesday that it will decide whether to declare an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the South China Sea in accordance with the level of threat.
""The ADIZ is not a Chinese invention, but rather that of some big powers. If our security were threatened, of course we have the right. It depends on our comprehensive judgment,"" said Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin at a press briefing at the Information Office of the State Council.
A white paper titled ""China Adheres to the Position of Settling Through Negotiation the Relevant Disputes Between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea"" was published on Wednesday, after an award was issued on Tuesday in the arbitration unilaterally initiated by the former Philippine government.
Liu urged other countries not to ""take the opportunity to threaten China,"" and called on other countries to work with China to jointly maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.
Liu reiterated that settling relevant disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea through negotiation is the consistent policy of the Chinese government.
The South China Sea issue is not a problem between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Liu stressed, saying that China would make joint efforts with ASEAN countries to resolve the disputes through negotiations, manage disputes by making rules, and achieve win-win results by practical cooperation.
""We hope to work with countries surrounding the South China Sea, including ASEAN members, abide by the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, maintain peace and stability as well as the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea,"" Liu said.
He noted such a policy has not changed and will not change.
As for the arbitration award, the vice foreign minister reaffirmed that China will not execute the award. He called on the Philippines to return to the track of bilateral negotiation.
The five-member arbitration tribunal is neither an international tribunal nor an international court of justice under the UN framework, he said, adding that it is neither an international tribunal for the law of the sea nor a permanent court of arbitration.
Thus, he said the tribunal lacks authority and credibility, and the award of the South China Sea arbitration is null and void.
He said China has made unremitting efforts to resolve the South China Sea issue in a peaceful manner, and reached important consensus with successive Philippine governments on resolving the disputes peacefully and promoting maritime practical cooperation.
Commenting on the positive reactions from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his government, Liu said China stands ready to work with the new Philippine government, properly settle the South China Sea disputes and bring bilateral ties back to the right track at an early date.
The two countries will continue promoting maritime cooperation and common development, and not allow the disputes to affect the healthy development of their relations and peace and stability in the region, according to the vice foreign minister.

 South China Sea arbitration award solves nothing: senior European parliamentarian

"|"

BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The award of the South China Sea arbitration solves nothing and the dispute between the Philippines and China can only be solved through bilateral dialogue, a British member of the European Parliament (MEP) said Tuesday.
The arbitration was unilaterally initiated in 2013 by the former Philippine government and its award was issued on Tuesday. China reiterated its stance that it neither accepts nor recognizes the ruling.
""The award is null and void and has no binding force,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
""It is a matter of territorial dispute; I think this issue should not have gone to The Hague,"" Nirj Deva, vice chairman of the European Parliament's Development Committee and chairman of the EU-China Friendship Group in the European Parliament, told Xinhua.
He noted that sovereignty and territorial disputes are not under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
The lawmaker said former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III made ""a wrong decision"" to go to The Hague. It broke the country' s own commitment made in the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC).
According to DOC, China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to settle their regional disputes through consultation and negotiation.
However, by not consulting China about involving a third party, the Philippines walked away from its DOC committments.
By contrast, Deva praised China for abiding by its international commitments.
""On the whole, if you look at China' s history, China has been a very good obeyer of international laws and has kept to all international treaties that it has signed,"" he said.
It is widely believed that the South China Sea arbitration will only serve to escalate tensions in the region instead of solving disputes. Deva said the award ""doesn' t solve anything.""
He pointed out that the dispute between the Philippines and China is a bilateral issue, which can only be solved through dialogue and consultation.
Furthermore, he stressed that countries outside the region should respect efforts made by China and ASEAN to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea.
The countries meddling in the South China Sea may have concerns about their own interests, in international shipping or aviation. However, the lawmaker stressed there has not been ""one single complaint"" about any interference from China in international shipping lanes.
""Their concerns are based on hypothetical situations but not on the real facts on the ground,"" he said.
Noting that the new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has expressed the desire to engage in dialogue with China, the senior lawmaker called for the European Union (EU) to play a constructive role in the process.
""Firstly, the EU should not interfere in this matter; secondly, we should encourage as much as we can the two sides to come together to the negotiation table, discussing these matters of mutual concerns and interests.""
The EU-China Friendship Group in the European Parliament consists of more than 40 lawmakers from at least seven political groups and more than 20 countries.

 Arbitral tribunal's decision against China illegal: LatAm experts

"|"
BUENOS AIRES, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The award issued by the Arbitral Tribunal in the South China Sea arbitration case is ""illegal,"" and the territorial dispute must be resolved through bilateral dialogue, many Latin American experts have said.
Gustavo Girado, head of the Buenos Aires-based Asia & Argentina Consultancy, told Xinhua recently that ""first of all, one major question that must be resolved is how this tribunal can establish an opinion over sovereignty matter in maritime spaces.""
""It seems that the Philippines was driven to go to an inadequate institution like the PCA, while going against previous agreements with China, by foreign forces that have a vested stake in the dispute. This has led to a military scaling-up in the region,"" he said.
Judicial expert Paola de Simone told Xinhua that the PCA's award in favor of the Philippines could hamper future efforts to resolve the dispute through bilateral negotiation.
For her, the Philippines ""violated its commitment"" as part of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.
Arbitration by uninvolved third parties is ""an excessive instrument,"" as ""bilateral dialogue"" must always be an option, Simone said.
Echoing their views, Evandro Carvalho, a professor of international law at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, said ""it would be very difficult for a nation to admit the jurisdiction of an international tribunal on such a matter.""
According to Carvalho, it is the basic rule of international law that allows China to explicitly reject the arbitration process initiated unilaterally by the Philippines.
The expert urged the Philippines to reconsider its action, saying that the complexity of the South China Sea issue deserves a diplomatic solution instead of seeking extra-judicial resolutions.
For Ulises Granados, coordinator of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Autonomous Technology Institute of Mexico (ITAM), the award ""does not have much weight.""
""In terms of procedure, as long as China has not submitted to the decision of the court, nothing will happen. There will be no consequences from the award,"" he said.
Granados believed that the arrival of the new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte opens up a new chance for dialogue.
""It is clear that acting only through a judicial path will not force China to do anything at all,"" the Granados said.

c_135508118.htm|2016-07-12| Tribunal's award destabilizes Asia Pacific|"

BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The award announced Tuesday by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague on the South China Sea went beyond its legal powers and will eventually destabilize the Asia-Pacific region, a scholar has said here.
The ruling by the PCA is should be null and void since issues of territorial sovereignty and maritime demarcation are not subject to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), said Aamir Khan, a visiting faculty member at Beijing Dublin International College at Beijing University of Technology said in an op-ed published in China Daily last week.
""That the Philippines has camouflaged its case under the cloak of a generation of entitlements to islands does not hide the fact that its dispute with China is indeed about territorial sovereignty and maritime demarcation,"" said Khan.
He said Article 281 of UNCLOS stipulates that the convention applies only if the parties have not agreed on a settlement, while the Philippines has jointly issued a series of bilateral agreements with China and signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.
The Philippines will not benefit from the ruling as it will ""only succeed in plunging its long friendly relations with the economic powerhouse to a nadir and lose the golden opportunity to develop its economy"" as well as lose the chance to jointly develop disputed waters in the South China Sea with China, said Khan.
Also, the ill-founded arbitration may ""open a can of worm,"" leading other countries to follow suit with filing abusive lawsuits, he added.
More alarmingly, Khan pointed out that the ruling will destabilize the South China Sea by encouraging military existence, taking the United States as an example, which deployed two aircraft carriers in seas east of the Philippines last month and started monitoring the South China Sea with guided-missiles destroyers.
""History provides ample examples of small incidents leading to major consequences,"" warned Khan. ""The Asia-Pacific region, brought to its knees by Japanese aggression in World War II, has taken 70 years to rise again and achieve unparalleled economic growth. It will be heartbreaking to see this reversed.""
Manila, despite gaining a closer relationship with the United States, may find that Washington's ""pivot to Asia"" strategy is not in line with its own long-term interests, said Khan.
The author cited China's Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai's recent remarks that the United States often misperceives China's efforts in maintaining its legitimate position as a move to challenge the super power's global dominance. He further cited the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative as other examples of how the country is misinformed of China's intentions.
There actually were better choices in front of the United States and the Philippines to help keep peace and stability in the Asia Pacific, said the author.
""Well-wishers of the United States will want it to resume the role of a 'wise leader' and jointly enact with China ... a more inclusive security structure to help maintain peace and stability in the region,"" Khan said. ""And well-wishers of the Philippines would advise President Rodrigo Duterte to withdraw its case before it is too late and return to the negotiating table,"" he added.

c_135507910.htm|2016-07-12| Spotlight: Busting myths of South China Sea arbitration|"

By Yang Dingdu, Ling Shuo
THE HAGUE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The tribunal handling the South China Sea arbitration case unilaterally initiated by the former Philippine government issued its final award on Tuesday, but as the panel has no jurisdiction, its decision is naturally null and void.
In a press release accompanying the 479-page award, the five-member tribunal offered a summary of its decisions, which sweepingly side with the claims filed by the administration of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III.
China has refused to participate in the proceedings, reiterating that the tribunal has no jurisdiction over the case, which is in essence related to territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation.
""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China solemnly declares that the award is null and void and has no binding force. China neither accepts nor recognizes it,"" the ministry said in a statement shortly after the publication of the award.
It should be the ultimate goal of any international institution to help resolve conflicts, maintain peace and limit armaments. These were also the founding principles of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) when it was established over a hundred years ago.
However, the arbitral tribunal the PCA organized over the South China Sea issue seems to have intensified the disputes between Beijing and Manila, putting regional peace at risk while spurring military buildup. Questions have been raised over the legitimacy of the arbitration.
STALLED TALKS
Before the arbitration was filed, China and the Philippines, along with other countries involved, had engaged in constructive talks over disputes in the South China Sea for years.
Those talks yielded a declaration that regulates the conduct of involved parties in the waterway so as to ensure regional peace. The parties also fostered a ""dual track"" approach of maintaining peace while holding talks on disputes.
However, it became difficult to hold talks ever since the administration of former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III initiated the arbitration in 2013. Dialogues were disrupted after the tribunal claimed jurisdiction two years later.
Since talks stalled, tensions have mounted. U.S. warships and planes have frequented the South China Sea under the pretext of safeguarding ""freedom of navigation and overflight.""
Meanwhile, Washington and Manila held a slew of joint military drills near the waters of the South China Sea. The scale of their war games kept increasing while the weapons used by their servicemen became increasingly sophisticated.
In April, thousands of U.S., Philippine and Australian troops attended an 11-day exercise in the South China Sea region, which deployed the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, capable of firing waves of rockets and missiles from a long range with great accuracy.
The high-profile U.S. military presence only cast a pall on the otherwise peaceful South China Sea, through which more than 100,000 ships pass annually without incidents.
""LAWFARE""
The U.S. intervention won't end with military muscle-flexing. Observers said that the arbitration is part of the ""lawfare"" that the United States has waged against China, by manipulating lawsuits and legal systems to tarnish China's claims and rights.
Although the arbitration was initiated by the Aquino III administration in 2013, U.S. support and abetment were crucial to its being carried forward. The 3,000-page documents that the Philippines handed over to the tribunal were compiled with the help of U.S. legal experts who also participated in the process of deliberations.
The U.S. support, analysts said, is also a key factor that encouraged the tribunal to accept and then claim jurisdiction over the flawed case.
In 2010, then U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that Washington has national interests in the South China Sea, amid the U.S.strategic shift to the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States and the Philippines issued a joint statement to back the arbitration in 2014. Later that year, U.S. President Barack Obama, during a visit to Manila, voiced his support for the arbitration.
QUESTIONABLE JURISDICTION
Outwardly, Manila's request was to determine the nature of features ""under Chinese control"" in the South China Sea. But its real agenda was to confuse the maritime rights assigned to different features, e.g. islands, low-tide elevations or submerged banks, with China's sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and its waters.
By dwelling on the nature of the features, the Philippines has attempted to limit China's maritime rights and interests to individual features, denying China's historic rights over the Nansha Islands as a whole.
Hence, the Philippines' requests are essentially about territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation. Territorial issues are subject to general international law rather than the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), under which the tribunal operates.
In addition, China excluded disputes concerning maritime delimitation, historic bays or titles from UNCLOS dispute settlement procedures in 2006, according to the UNCLOS stipulation.
HISTORICAL FACTS
Before the colonization of Southeast Asia by Western powers, the South China Sea had been a peaceful and prosperous hub for trade and cultural exchanges for over a thousand years.
In AD 671, the Chinese monk Yi Jing set sail across the South China Sea to study Buddhism in India and came back 25 years later. During his journey, Yi visited 30 ancient countries in the South China Sea region, during which he shared Chinese culture and technology with his hosts.
Yi was among more than 60 Chinese monks who traveled through the South China Sea to India during that period. Their writings and travel logs are evidence that proves China's active role in promoting peace and prosperity in the waters.
In various Chinese dynasties, offices on sea affairs were set up, along with the launch of coast patrols to ensure safe passage in the waterway. For about a hundred years, China had worked with the state of Malacca to combat piracy in the South China Sea, until Malacca was colonized by Portugal in 1611.
MEDIA MISINFORMATION
China's rights over the South China Sea are backed by numerous historical records. However, some Western media have either turned a blind eye to the facts or twisted them to make up their own version of the ""truth.""
In Tanmen, a fishing village in southern China, a retired fisherman told BBC that he once had an ancient book with navigation directions to the South China Sea. But he threw it away as it was no longer readable after being used for hundreds of years.
Upon hearing this, the BBC reporter started to question the existence of the book, suggesting the old fisherman, who had trusted him with his family story, was lying. He went on to accuse Chinese media, which had first reported on the book, of having made up the story to bolster China's claims.
Had the reporter bothered to visit the Hainan Provincial Museum, he would have seen those ancient navigation guides on public display.
In fact, generations of fishermen living in a number of harbors in Hainan have relied on such ancient guides to navigate in the South China Sea. At least 12 versions of them can be found in museums or fishing villages.
NEGOTIATION THE ONLY WAY
Any ultimate resolution of territorial issues must be based on the will of the states involved. History, national interests and people's feelings of each side need to be acknowledged and taken into consideration before any reconciliation and agreement can be achieved.
A rushed decision by a third party often leads to more disputes and conflicts. In Southeast Asia alone, problematic demarcations by colonists left Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Cambodia with long-standing land disputes among them and even separatist violence.
The South China Sea issue involves waters of 3.5 million square kilometers and several parties in the region. Its magnitude and complexity far exceed the capacity of any tribunal.
In addition, China has made it clear that the arbitration is illegal, null and void, and that the country does not accept it or participate in it.
Without China's acknowledgement and support, the ""award"" of the arbitration is practically infeasible, or ""just a piece of paper,"" as described by former Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo.
""China will never give up our lawful rights. Chinese people do not believe in fallacy nor are we afraid of evil forces,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping said on July 1, commemorating the 95th founding anniversary of the Communist Party of China.
""Chinese people do not make trouble, but we are not cowards when involved in trouble,"" Xi said.
The newly-elected Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has on multiple occasions shown willingness to resume talks with the Chinese side, a good starting point for reconciliation and mutual understanding between the two countries.
Hopefully, this ""piece of paper"" can serve as a lesson to remind all parties involved that there is no shortcut to resolving the South China Sea issue, and that the final solution to it can only be found at the negotiation table.

c_135507809.htm|2016-07-12| Commentary: Time to end South China Sea arbitration farce|"

by Xinhua Writer Jiang Li
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The South China Sea arbitration came to an end with an arbitral tribunal in The Hague issuing an award on Tuesday, but the verdict is null and void and only serves to complicate the situation in the region.
With obvious loopholes and deliberate proceedings circumventing regular arbitration rules, the tribunal undermines international law and sets a bad example for settling sovereign disputes.
China has reiterated its stance of non-participation in and non-acceptance of the arbitration. To fully respect international law and justice, China will never recognize the verdict and never be ""forced"" into accepting it.
The former Philippine government and the United States behind it have conspired for a long time to blackmail China regarding its historic rights to the South China Sea, but to do it through a tribunal that tramples on international justice goes too far.
For starters, Manila broke its own commitment made in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002, which was signed between China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to settle disputes through consultation and negotiation.
Without consulting with China over the means of dispute settlement, the former Philippine government unilaterally filed a compulsory arbitration against China in 2013.
Despite Manila's claim to seek a verdict over the status and maritime entitlements of relevant features in the Nansha Islands, the subject matter regards sovereignty and delimitation issues clearly beyond the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.
To make matters worse, some countries outside the region have been making waves to serve their own interests.
The United States has been attempting to ""fish in troubled waters"" while instigating the Philippines to act on the so-called legal front. Sending warships and warplanes and holding military maneuvers, the United States has spared no efforts to stir up the waters of the South China Sea with its so-called ""Pivot to Asia"" strategy.
Meanwhile, Japan is an accomplice that attempted to hijack the Group of Seven meeting in April with the South China Sea issue as part of its efforts to serve its audacious ambitions.
The arbitration has only escalated tensions in the region and by no means helps to solve the disputes. The undermining of international law and the repercussions of a law-abusing arbitration are even more worrying than the dispute itself.
The new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has expressed the desire to engage in dialogue with China on the South China Sea issue, which is a welcomed sign.
Under the dual-track approach initially proposed by ASEAN, China and the Philippines could negotiate in line with international law and get bilateral ties back on track.
It's high time to put an end to this farce that has dragged on for too long.

MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The military on Monday claimed to have killed around 40 members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in skirmishes in the southern Philippines since last week as part of the military's efforts to end the terrorist group.
Maj. Filemon Tan, spokesman of the military's Western Mindanao Command, said 25 other Abu Sayyaf men were also wounded based on intelligence information gathered by government troops.
""Focused military operations are intensified, in coordination with the police and the local governments of the provinces of Basilan and Sulu Province, to neutralize the Abu Sayyaf Group,"" said Tan.
The fighting in Basilan, particularly in the towns of Unkayan Pukan and Albarka, broke out last Wednesday, the military said.
In Sulu, the fighting erupted last Thursday in Patikul town. Artillery rounds were delivered to known positions of the Abu Sayyaf in the process.
The military initially reported the killing of nine Abu Sayyaf men and wounding of 13 others in the Sulu skirmishes.
Tan said the military casualties remained at one soldier killed and six others wounded, all from the Sulu firefight.
Tan said the number of Abu Sayyaf casualties increased Sunday to 40 dead and 25 wounded based on reports gathered -- 18 dead and nine wounded in the Basilan fighting; and 22 killed and 16 wounded in the Sulu fighting.
In Basilan, Tan said ""heavy firefight still ongoing involving armored vehicles, artillery fires and close-air support against the ASG"" as of around 4:30 p.m on Monday.
In his assumption speech last July 1, AFP chief Gen. Ricardo Visaya vowed a 24/7 or non-stop operations against the Abu Sayyaf, in keeping with the thrust of President Duterte to end the ASG.
Visaya said the the military will be unrelenting in the operations against the Abu Sayyaf and its allies. Army chief Lt. Gen. Eduardo Ano has said the goal is to end the Abu Sayyaf within the term of Visaya who is retiring on Dec. 8.
The Abu Sayyaf is keeping a dozen of foreign and Filipino hostages in Sulu, including seven Indonesian tugboat crew members abducted off the Sulu Sea last June 22. The group is also known for its beheading and bombing activities.

MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government is open for mandatory drug testing of its over 1.5 million employees to regain the trust of the public, a senior government official said Saturday.
There were calls from some quarters to allow government employees to also undergo drug testing amid the intensified campaign of the new administration of President Rodrigo Duterte against illegal drugs.
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella, in an interview over a state-run radio station, said the proposal was a welcome development ""just to prove to the people that all government workers are proper.""
He said that undergoing mandatory drug testing of government employees would be a ""very powerful symbolic act"" to show that they are people ""worthy of our trust.""
Shells said that it has been the priority of the President to bring back the public's trust and faith in the government.
Duterte has promised to address criminality, including the proliferation of illegal drugs, and corruption within three to six months of his administration.
He has ordered an investigation against five retired and active police generals whom he publicly named for their alleged involvement in illegal drugs in the country.

MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has accused the United States of importing and sowing terror to the Middle East, causing staggering violence and mayhem in that region.
In a speech before Muslim leaders in Davao City Friday night, Duterte said the U.S. imported terrorism to the Middle East, and not the other way around.
""That's what happened in the Middle East. It is not that the Middle East is exporting terrorism to America; America imported terrorism (to the Middle East),"" Duterte said.
""The U.S. destroyed the Middle East,"" he said, recounting how the U.S. invaded Iraq with the help of Britain in the 1990s.
""(They say Saddam Husein was a dictator) but he was in control of the country. After almost 10 years of investigation, it turned out there was no legal basis to declare war against Iraq. You see, it's a useless war,"" Duterte said.
""Great Britain and the U.S. will not admit that they forced their way to Iraq and killed Saddam. Look at Iraq now. Look what happened to Libya. Look what happened to Syria. Even children are being doused with gasoline. They were pushed to the wall for the failed promises,"" Duterte said.
Duterte urged the Muslim leaders to work for peace rather than engage in war.
""That is why I am not including Abu Sayyaf in the criminality. It is a different set-up there because these are the guys who were driven to desperation,"" Duterte added.
He said from Nur Misuari, the rebel leader, to Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, there was no semblance of governance. And that is why they are pushed to the wall, then became radicalized.
""That's also what happened in the Middle east,"" Duterte said.
The Philippine government has been fighting the Abu Sayyaf rebels since the 1990s. Past administrations have labeled the group, numbering about 400, as bandits or criminals that carries out illegal activities including kidnappings for ransom, killings and bombings in Mindanao in southern Philippines.

Commentary: There should be a war crimes tribunal for Iraq invasion
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited report of Britain's official inquiry into the war on Iraq confirms what has long been suspected, but it fails to take notice of an inconvenient truth by not mentioning that it was a war waged illegally.x There should be a war crimes tribunal for the perpetrators of the war that left hundreds of thousands dead and millions homeless and had been at the root of the wave of refugees plaguing Europe years later.
The inquiry led by retired British civil servant John Chilcot found that the British government based its decision to deploy troops to Iraq on flawed intelligence and underestimated the consequences of the invasion. Full story

 Interview: South China Sea arbitration likely to stir more regional tensions: Italian expert

"|"

by Alessandra Cardone
ROME, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming arbitration on the South China Sea dispute by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague is likely to stir more tensions in the region, said an Italian expert.
""I reckon the judgement of the court will not help the dialogue between the two parties involved, China and the Philippines, but rather worsen the crisis,"" Domenico Losurdo, a famous Italian historical philosopher and professor at the University of Urbino, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
""Bilateral negotiations would be instead the most effective path to solve the dispute,"" he added.
The two countries had already reached an agreement on settling their South China Sea disputes through bilateral negotiations in the mid-1990s, and again in the early 2000.
Yet, the Philippines unilaterally decided to bring the issue before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2013, seeking arbitration over the case.
""By unilaterally filing the case against Beijing at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Philippines clearly contradicted its commitment to the ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), which it had previously signed,"" the expert said.
The DOC expressed the desire to enhance favorable conditions for a peaceful and durable solution of differences and disputes through friendly negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned.
""That Agreement also appealed for the parties to exercise self-restraint, and avoid taking actions that could complicate or escalate the disputes,"" Losurdo stressed.
""The unilateral initiative by the Philippine has exactly resulted in such an escalation, the outcome of which is now difficult to forecast,"" added the expert.
Losurdo, a professor emeritus of Philosophy and former Dean of the Science of Education Faculty at the University of Urbino, said the Philippines' step made more sense in a broader, geopolitical perspective.
It was necessary to consider the U.S. strategic ""pivot to Asia"" or rebalancing launched by U.S. President Barack Obama's administration, which marked a shift in American foreign policy from the Middle East and Mediterranean area to the Asian Pacific region.
""It is within this context that the Philippines decided to drop negotiations (with China) in 2013, and resort to arbitration before the Permanent Court with the help of U.S. legal consultants,"" said Losurdo.
According to the expert, the whole issue would serve U.S. interests in terms of preserving its hegemony in the Asian Pacific region, confining China as a ""land power"" only, and making a U.S. naval blockade easier during a possible crisis.
China asserts the international tribunal has no authority over such a case, which is essentially about territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation, and made clear it will not accept the arbitration.
""This is also a widely shared view among international jurists. And the Permanent Court of Arbitration itself seems to indirectly confirm this line, by assessing the claim as a matter of interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),"" Losurdo said.
""Yet, the dispute is indeed about the sovereignty of the South China Sea islands,"" the expert added.
Furthermore, China excluded maritime delimitation from compulsory arbitration in a declaration made in 2006, in accordance with Article 298 of UNCLOS concerning the optional exceptions to the applicability of the U.N. Convention.
As Chinese authorities recently called again on Manila to abandon the arbitration application and return to bilateral negotiations, Losurdo suggested a positive development might come with the newly elected president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte.
""The new president seems more open to dialogue. Somehow, bilateral negotiations might still resurface as the main pathway to solve this dispute,"" he told Xinhua.

c_135499299.htm|2016-07-08| Spotlight: Filipino expert says arbitration ruling can't be leverage for Philippines, urging talks with China|"

MANILA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- An impending arbitration ruling on
the South China Sea case cannot be a leverage for the Philippines
if it is analyzed objectively, a Philippine expert has said,
stressing the country needs to talk with China to benefit itself as
well as the region.

Alberto Encomienda, former secretary-general of the Maritime and
Ocean Affairs Center of the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department,
made the remarks in a recent interview with Xinhua.

An arbitral tribunal with widely contested jurisdiction will
issue an award on July 12 on the South China Sea case unilaterally
initiated by the Philippines, the Permanent Court of Arbitration
(PCA) in The Hague said last week.

China has refused to participate in the proceedings and declared
that it will never recognize the verdict, stressing that the
tribunal has no jurisdiction because the case is in essence related
to territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation.

After the PCA set date for the issuance of the final award,
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei reaffirmed that the
arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction over the case and the
relevant subject-matter, and that it should not have heard the case
or rendered the award.

Encomienda, in the interview, called for talks with China,
pointing out that the Philippines and China ""cannot be without each
other, bow and arrow"" and that China has ""shown the openness to
reconnect"" with the Philippines and ""Our issue is how to reconnect
in a nice way.""

The former diplomat said negotiations are in form of give and
take and there are a lot of issues the Philippines can bring to
China for a win-win situation, adding that both sides can agree to
set aside the ruling and continue with joint development.

He expressed optimism on the future of the Philippines-China
relations under the Duterte administration. However, he also noted
that during the administration of former President Benigno S.
Aquino III, the mindset of the Filipinos had been poisoned.

In a separate interview, Lauro Baja, former Philippine foreign
affairs undersecretary, said there is more to the relationship than
a court ruling on the South China Sea disputes.

He said President Duterte has already expressed readiness and
willingness to have bilateral talks with China, adding, ""Duterte
said it because whether we lost or whether we win (in the arbitral
court), we have to talk with China.""

Echoing Baja, strategic analyst Cel Cainglet said, ""No matter
what ruling says, we have to talk to China again.""

Cainglet also stressed that ""U.S. has no right to interfere as
they are not even the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea) signatory,"" adding that the South China Sea disputes
should be solved among Asians. Enditem

 Interview: Unilateral arbitration will endanger peace, stability in South China Sea: French sinologue

"|"
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Arbitration by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) following the unilateral application of the Philippines over its dispute with China in the South China Sea ""would endanger the peace and stability"" in the region, said French sinologue Pierre Picquart.
""What seems questionable is a so-called 'international arbitration,' unrecognized by China, trying to impose a settlement between Beijing and Manila,"" Picquart told Xinhua in a recent interview.
While the PCA is about to announce on July 12 its decision over the request of the Philippines, presented unilaterally in 2013 concerning the territorial dispute between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea, China has repeatedly stated that it does not recognize the legitimacy of the court in this case and therefore can not accept its conclusions.
According to him, ""the interference, by one or more third parties with an indirect interest inviting other countries and organizations to express their opposition against China, would complicate and endanger the peace and stability in the South China Sea.""
""The arbitration over the South China Sea demanded by former Philippine president Benigno S. Aquino III will not lead to a peaceful solution. However, the new president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte wants to have a conversation with China over the disputes in the South China Sea, in order to, presumably, to have a mutually beneficial relationship (with China),"" Picquart said.
The China expert stressed that ""China has always encouraged 'win-win' partnerships and the bilateral dialogue in solving border issues.""
""This applies with the Philippines, just as in all other disputes in the South China Sea,"" and ""is consistent and logical that Beijing legitimately preserves its historic interests,"" he explained.
Picquart hopes that the dispute between China and the Philippines ""would be settled through bilateral negotiations based on respect for historical facts and in accordance with international law.""
He also wishes Manila would work with Beijing to ""appropriately find a balance in these disputes for the peace in the South China Sea.""

 China says arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction over China's historical rights

"|"
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday said the arbitral tribunal established at the request of the Philippines has no jurisdiction over China's historical rights in the South China Sea.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei made the remarks when asked to comment on the Philippines' claims in the case that China's historical rights do not comply with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
""Many articles of UNCLOS recognize the concepts of historic bays and historic ownership, showing respect for historical rights,"" Hong said at a regular news briefing.
Hong emphasized China's historical rights in the South China Sea are supported by historical and jurisprudential evidence and protected by international laws including UNCLOS.
The Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who was sworn into office last week, said on Tuesday ahead of the July 12 ruling that ""if it's favorable to us, let's talk.""
On 22 January 2013, the Philippines initiated the arbitration. China has repeatedly insisted that the tribunal has no jurisdiction over the case and it will neither accept nor recognize the ruling.

 News Analysis: Philippine President Duterte aims ""soft-landing"" in talks with China

"|"
MANILA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is taking a ""soft-landing"" approach in exploring ways to renew friendly ties with China, which have been strained in the past years over the disputes in the South China Sea, analysts said on Wednesday.
This is a departure from his predecessor Benigno Aquino III, under whom the Philippines unilaterally initiated an arbitration case against China in 2013 over the dispute at the Permannent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.
At his first cabinet meeting after he was sworn in on June 30, Duterte, who had said he was open to talking with China about the territorial dispute, stated, ""If we can have peace by just talking I'll be really happy.""
Richard Heydarian, an associate professor at De la Salle University, said Duterte ""is taking a significant different approach, constantly emphasizing necessity for direct engagement and revival of bilateral ties.""
""He is signaling that neither the maritime disputes nor the arbitration case should negatively define the texture of overall bilateral relations,"" Heydarian said.
He said that Duterte was aiming at ""a soft-landing"" especially after the arbitration verdict is handed down on July 12, ""which may mean not aggressively criticizing China.""
In exchange, Heyadarian said Duterte will most likely seek for concessions in the South China Sea.
""A lot of horse trading is on the horizon,"" he said.
NOT EVEN ""WAR OF WORDS""
Even before he assumed the presidency, Duterte has made it clear that ""I am not ready to go to war,"" referring to the worst scenario of fighting between China and the Philippines over the disputes in the South China Sea.
Benito Lim, a political science professor, said Duterte wanted to engage China, making his position clear to China that he wanted direct talks and that he did not want to engage China in war, not even ""war of words.""
""It means that he wants to explore other avenues aside from letting the situation fester in the standoff,"" Lim said in an interview, adding that Duterte ""is trying to look for ways and means by which this long-time standoff can be removed and then agree on things that are mutually beneficial.""
Lim said this is a logical step on the part of the Duterte administration, adding that both countries can move on by forging ""cooperative and beneficial agreements.""
""He is sending a message to China that both countries can agree on mutually beneficial agreements instead of a standoff,"" Lim said.
""Exploring other avenues by which there can be agreements that are equally beneficial to both is better than saying bad things about each other,"" he said.
Moreover, he said that Duterte was ""addressing"" Philippine national interests by making this reconciliatory move with Beijing.
Duterte has said that the Philippines will charter a course of its own, shifting away from Aquino government's overarching dependence on U.S. military support.
""We will chartering a course of our own,"" Duterte has said.
""It will not be dependent on America, and it will be a line not intended to please anybody but the Filipino interests,"" said Lim.
Asked what the implication of Duterte's ""softening move"" will be on the country's relations with the United States, Lim said, ""Philippine interests will not be formulated whether the international community would look at it with approval or not. It would be in the interests of the Philippines.""
Lim said Duterte's statement that he would wait for the ruling and study its implications meant that even if it were in our favor ""he will still examine the consequences of what that decision means.""
TO HAVE STRONG TRADE, INVESTMENT RELATIONS
Rommel Banlaoi, director of the Center for Intelligence and National Security Studies, said Duterte wanted to open direct talks with China on many facets of diplomatic relations like economic and trade, and not just about political issues like the South China Sea.
Banlaoi said Duterte was not just exploring ways ""to revive the stagnant relations between Beijing and Manila but he also wants a better economic ties with China.""
""Duterte does not want the bilateral relationship with China to revolve around the dispute on the South China Sea, meaning that his administration is willing to talk about other, more equally important aspect of the relations,"" Banlaoi said.
In an editorial on Monday, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said that despite its territorial dispute with China, it is possible for the Philippines to have strong trade and investment relations with China, adding one major avenue for this is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
""The AIIB has been described as modern and multilateral, or China's 21st-century answer to lenders like the World Bank and the ADB (Asian Development Bank). And the Philippines will be better off borrowing through a more transparent window now,"" the editorial said.
Banlaoi said Duterte was fostering an independent foreign policy, ""a policy that is not pro this and against that"" despite what he described as ""tremendous pressure"" from strategic partners like the United States and its allies in the region.
""It's a difficult and delicate balancing act,"" Balaoi said, adding that Duterte was determined to have good relations with everybody.
On the forthcoming arbitral ruling, Banlaoi said the administration has already said that it will carefully study the ruling before taking the next step.
""My reading is that the administration will make sure that its next step will support its position to bring back good ties with China,"" he said.

 Commentary: S. China Sea arbitration simply bad for Southeast Asia

"|"
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The South China Sea arbitration unilaterally initiated by former Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III has not only soured China-Philippines ties, but also undermined international rule of law and regional stability.
The arbitration was a bad idea from the beginning for one simple reason: it is detrimental to the interests of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that groups 10 member states, including the Philippines.
Firstly, the integrity of ASEAN is at stake. The United States, a close ally of the Philippines, has long interfered in the region and is using the arbitration to widen divisions and undermine mutual trust. ASEAN members have differed on the South China Sea issue, the arbitration, as well as external intervention by non-regional countries.
Secondly, the arbitration compromises existing ASEAN rules of conduct. For more than half a century, ASEAN member states have emphasized a spirit of equality, consensus and cooperation.
For example, the dual-track approach, originally thought up by ASEAN and supported by China, advocates that disputes should be resolved peacefully through negotiations between parties directly concerned. It further calls on China and ASEAN to work together to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.
The dual-track approach is the most pragmatic way to manage maritime and territorial disputes in the South China Sea. It is also in full compliance with the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), signed by China and all ASEAN members in 2002.
However, the unilateral arbitration against China completely disregards the DOC, denies the double-track approach and ignores ASEAN's many past achievements in using negotiation as a tool to resolving disputes.
Thirdly, regional security is at risk. The frequent visits by aircraft and warships from countries outside the region are a deep concern for ASEAN and could spark an arms race. Some external countries having a hidden agenda are repeatedly muddying the waters, leaving regional countries to bear the brunt of any consequent instability.
More importantly, arbitration isn't a panacea to solving disputes. Instead, it more likely creates more disputes and stokes regional tensions, doing harm to the fundamental interests of peoples in the region.
With regard to the so-called arbitration, China has repeated its stance of non-acceptance of third-party dispute settlements or any imposed solution.
The disputes between China and the Philippines can only be solved via bilateral negotiations on the basis of fully respecting historical facts and in line with international laws.
Since winning election, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made a string of overtures on Philippines-China relations, with his spokesperson Ernesto Abella having said that Duterte wanted a ""conversation"" with China on the South China Sea to work out a ""win-win relationship"" with the country.
If Duterte is serious about solving the South China Sea issue properly and about bringing the China-Philippines ties back on track, it is time for him to act as a responsible player and make the right choice to eliminate the advance effects caused by the arbitration farce as soon as possible.

 Philippines, other developing countries need China's AIIB: newspaper

"|"
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The widely circulated Philippine Daily Inquirer on Monday ran an editorial saying the Philippines can avail itself of the infrastructure lending program being offered by Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to finance the country's massive infrastructure needs.
The editorial, headlined ""China Funding Initiative,"" says the Philippines and other developing countries in the region will need the AIIB and benefit from it.
""The AIIB has been described as modern and multilateral, or China's '21st-century' answer to lenders like the World Bank, which has always been led by Americans, and the Asian Development Bank, which is dominated by Japan,"" says the editorial.
""And the Philippines will be better off borrowing through a more transparent AIIB lending window now,"" it says.
The ADB estimates that the region requires 750 billion U.S. dollars in investment annually until 2020 to fund its infrastructure needs, which the bank says it cannot finance on its own.
""The Philippines' infrastructure financing needs from 2010 through 2020 was placed at 127.12 billion U.S. dollars. This will require an annual investment of 11.56 billion U.S. dollars, which the government failed to fill in the past six year,"" the editorial says.
The Philippines has maritime and territorial disputes with China on the South China Sea. Diplomatic relations between Manila and Beijing soured when Manila brought the case to a U.N. arbitral tribunal in 2013.
But despite the Philippines' territorial dispute, the editorial says ""it's possible for the Philippines to have strong trade and investment relations with the global economic powerhouse.""
""One major avenue for this is the AIIB, which the Philippines joined at the last minute in December 2015,"" the editorial says.
Since its launch last January, it says the AIIB has approved four loans worth 509 million U.S. dollars for projects in Pakistan, Tajikistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh. ""Multilateral lenders such as World Bank usually take more than a year to approve similar project loans,"" it says.
The bank could support projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to link Asia, Europe and Africa through the construction of massive infrastructure such as railways and ports.
The editorial says the Belt and Road Initiative is believed by some experts to even help ease tension around the South China Sea as it expands economic cooperation among neighbors in the region.
""Billions of dollars in investments are expected to pour into the construction of railway facilities, airports and sea ports and power plants that, in turn, would trigger the growth of job-generating factories. Beside, while it is true that the AIIB is linked to China's own economic and strategic goals, what is wrong in having better China-funded infrastructure in the country?"" the article says.
The Philippines signed the Articles of Agreement of the AIIB in December last year, officially joining the newly-created multilateral institution aimed at boosting infrastructure development and connectivity.
In a statement before the signing, then Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said Manila believes that AIIB ""will augment and complement existing multilateral institutions in accelerating economic growth.""
Last month, new Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, through his spokesperson Paola Alvarez, told the Inquirer that the new administration of President Rodrigo Duterte will ""definitely pursue joining the AIIB"" to increase the country's spending.
""With (heavy vehicular) traffic and the lack of basic infrastructure projects being hindrances to Philippine economic prosperity, the membership of the Philippines to AIIB is surely something that the people will benefit from,"" the Inquirer quoted Alvarez as saying.

""I have already said that I have zero tolerance policy on use of illegal drugs and yet nine tested positive for illegal drugs. This is alarming,"" De la Rosa said. He said the mandatory test will continue.
De la Rosa himself underwent the same test last Friday along with other PNP's top officials. All tested negative, according to the results.
De la Rosa assumed the PNP's top post on Friday, a day after President Rodrigo Duterte was sworn into office as the country's 16th president June 30.
""Surrender in 48 hours or die,"" de la Rosa said in a speech during the turnover ceremony attended by Duterte Friday, warning police generals and police officers suspected of coddling drug lords.
""We will be relentless in our internal cleansing efforts, w have to eliminate the scallywags from within our ranks,"" he said. ""You. corrupt, abusive, lazy copes and those involved in syndicates, your days are numbered.""

Otherwise, go on AWOL and become full-time drug lords and fight us.""

BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- As the farce of arbitration on the South China Sea is to end soon, it is time for the new Philippine government of Rodrigo Duterte to stop the wrong foreign policy of its predecessor, so as to bring China-Philippines ties back to the track of sound development.
Since Duterte assumed presidency on Thursday, sparks of hope have arisen for resumption of sound development of relations between China and the Philippines after bilateral ties seriously deteriorated during the rule of former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III.
In 2013, the government of Aquino III filed a case of arbitration with the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration over territorial disputes between China and the Philippines on the South China Sea, stoking tensions in the South China Sea region.
On June 29 -- just a day before the assumption of presidency by Duterte, the Permanent Court of Arbitration announced that an arbitral award in the case initiated by the Philippines against China will be issued on July 12, meaning that the farce of arbitration started by the government of Aquino III will come to an end in days.
Since winning the election, Duterte has made a series of overtures on China-Philippines relations, signaling that improvement of relations with China would be a foreign policy priority of his government, in sharp contrast to the wrong foreign policy pursued by the former government.
As whoever started the trouble should be responsible for settling it, any substantial improvement of relations between China and the Philippines under the current situation actually depends on efforts of the Philippine side. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether the new Philippine government will be able to play the role of settling the trouble left over by the former government, how long it will take before the new Philippine government can shake off the burden of wrong diplomacy created by its predecessor, how much efforts it will make in this endeavor, and how it will face the serious harm caused by the farce of arbitration to China-Philippines relations.
Today, there do exist chances for the new Philippine government to substantially improve relations with China, and also for it to eliminate negative impacts of the farce of arbitration on China-Philippine relations and even on the regional situation.
In a message to congratulate Duterte on his victory in the election more than one month ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that China and the Philippines see a long history of friendly exchanges and profound traditional friendship between the two peoples.
""A friendly, stable and sound China-Philippines relationship is in the fundamental interest of the two countries and the two peoples,"" Xi said, adding that he hoped the two sides would work together to get bilateral relations back onto the track of sound development.
In response, Duterte said he was ""honored"" to receive the congratulatory message from the Chinese president, calling him a great leader.
""I was honored receiving a congratulatory message from a great president,"" Duterte reportedly made the remarks when speaking with reporters in Davao City after unveiling the members of his cabinet to the media.
The indirect ""dialogue"" reflected by the two foregoing passages has been interpreted as a positive signal for improvement of relations between China and the Philippines. It is noteworthy that both sides mentioned therein the history of China-Philippines relations, and that both emphasized the existence of a long history of friendly exchange between China and the Philippines and the maintenance of profound traditional friendship between the Chinese and Philippine peoples.
Since ancient times, China and the Philippines have maintained friendly exchange and profound traditional friendship between the two peoples, which is just one of the reasons why the two countries can get bilateral ties back onto the track of sound development despite negative impacts of the wrong foreign policy pursued by the government of Aquino III.
In history, the South China Sea used to be an important link via which the two countries conducted friendly and equal exchanges.
Historical literature ""The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898"" gave an account of a story about friendly contacts between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea.
In 1626 AD, the region of today's Hermosa in the Philippine province of Bataan was facing a severe famine, but the then Manila government was unable to offer aid to the region. Local Catholics had to pray every day that Chinese merchant ships could come as annually scheduled to help them cope with the emergency. Shortly afterwards, when six Chinese ships fully loaded with rice arrived on Hermosa port from the South China Sea, the locals hailed the timely rescue as ""a gift from God.""
Almost at the same time, chronicles of southeast China's Fujian Province known as ""The Book of Fujian"" also recorded a history of people-to-people contacts between the two countries, saying that sweet potato widely planted in today's China had actually been introduced from Luzon -- today's Philippines.
At that time, after seeing that sweet potato was widely grown in Luzon and its growth had gained good harvests, businessmen took sweet potato plants via the South China Sea to Fujian, where they were successfully planted. During the first years of extensive cultivation of sweet potato, it helped local people survive famines.
In the long history, the South China Sea mainly played the role as such a link and platform for equal exchanges and common development between China and neighboring countries.
However, in the past few years, the government of Aquino III put aside the traditional friendship between the two countries and the needs of the Philippine people's livelihood and development by pursuing a wrong foreign policy that led to serious deterioration of relations between China and the Philippines. Considering oral promises made by some countries outside the region as a security umbrella and economic driving force, Aquino III internationalized the South China Sea issue and was willing to serve as a vanguard for those countries in muddying the waters in the South China Sea.
In fact, it is difficult for Manila to find its real security interests from the frequent navigation by foreign military vessels on the South China Sea.
In economy, the promises of some Western countries have not helped improve the people's livelihood in the Philippines. Instead, escalation of South China Sea disputes has deprived many Filipinos of their means of survival.
Therefore, the cognitive, decision-making and strategic errors the Aquino government committed will finally bring bitter fruit to its people and even undermine regional stability and prosperity.
Only enhancing win-win cooperation and developing the economy are in the fundamental interests of the two countries.
As is known to all, China has been prudent and tolerant in handling its relations with the Philippines while considering the Philippine people's livelihood.
In 2015, bilateral relations were difficult, and the trade between China and other Asian countries as well as between China and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations went down by 7.8 percent and 1.7 percent respectively. However, the China-Philippines trade hit a record high of 45.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 2.7 percent from a year ago.
Now, China has become the Philippines' largest source of imports, second largest trade partner and third largest export market. The two countries are complementary to each other in industry, with the existence of great potential for economic growth and broad prospects for investment cooperation, which makes up a right way for mutually beneficial cooperation compared to the empty promises some countries made to Aquino III.
In the 1980s, then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, after meeting then Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel and then Philippine President Corazon Aquino successively, proposed peacefully solving the South China Sea disputes, and shelving disputes while seeking joint development. The reason why such a constructive consensus was reached was that the two sides realized that hope was far more than difficulties and common interests were far more than differences.
Only through cooperation and common development can China-Philippines relations be brought back onto the track of sound development. As long as the Philippines remembers the history, envisages realities and refrains from jumping into traps set by some forces outside the region, it will not be difficult for it to substantially improve relations with China.

Duterte has named Attorney Rodolfo Salalima as head of the department and described Salalima as ""an information technology expert, an activist advocating the rights of the poor, and a long-time government servant are among the experts in their respective fields who have joined my Cabinet.""
Salalima was a former executive of a private Philippine telecommunication firm, serving as its chief legal counsel and as senior vice president for corporate and regulatory affairs until his retirement in 2008.
He represented the country's information and communication technology industry as Asia Pacific representative and vice chair of the International Telecommunication Union council working group, which crafted the amendments to the International Telecommunication Union constitution and convention in Geneva, Switzerland.

MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte wanted a ""conversation"" with China on the South China Sea in a bid to work out a ""win-win relationship"" with the country, presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said on Friday.
""Basically he's being friendly toward China. I think it's an indication on how he wants to handle the relationship, not to be adversarial but to really work out a relationship that will be win-win for both,"" Abella said in an interview with the television ANC.
""I think the point of the president is ... we are not in a position to engage military operations and stuff like that. So, it really makes common sense,"" he said.
A few hours after taking office as the country's 16th president Thursday, Duterte told a cabinet meeting at the presidential palace not to ""flaunt"" a possibly favorable ruling in a case filed by the Philippines at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.
The tribunal has said that it would be handing down the ruling on July 12.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Wednesday that the tribunal, ""established on the basis of illegal conduct and claims of the Philippines,"" has no jurisdiction over the case and the relevant subject matter, and should not have heard the case or render any award.
Duterte brought up the issue during the televised meeting.
While the decision on the arbitration case might be favorable to the Philippines, ""it would also put the country in an awkward position especially with China (in terms of relations),"" Duterte said.
""God knows I really do not want to declare any fighting with anybody. And if we can have peace by just talking, I would be very happy,"" he added.
Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay also informed Duterte during the meeting that he was ""averse"" to issuing a ""strong"" statement in case of a favorable ruling, rejecting suggestions by foreign representatives.

MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The newly-minted Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday that an arbitral tribunal's decision on the South China Sea disputes, even if favorable to the Philippines, would put his country in an awkward position with China.

c_135479269.htm|2016-06-30| News Analysis: Philippine new president faces challenges in rebuilding public confidence in gov't|"
By Wang Wen, Dario Agnote
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine new president Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday vowed to tackle the country's problems and rebuild public confidence in the government in his inauguration speech. Experts here believe he faces enormous challenges to achieve his goals.
Duterte won the Philippine presidential election held on May 9 with 16,601,997 votes, a lead of almost 7 million over the second-placer Manuel Roxas.
For many, especially the grassroots, Duterte himself embodies hope of change.
In his inauguration speech, the former Davao City mayor vowed to crack down on illegal drugs, high criminality and corruption, seek peaceful agreements with leftist and Moro rebels, and lift the poor out of poverty.
The 71-year-old politician believed that the ""erosion of faith and trust in government"" is the most serious problem facing his administration.
""I see the erosion of the people's trust in our country's leaders; the erosion of faith in our judicial system; the erosion of confidence in the capacity of our public servants to make the people's lives better, safer and healthier,"" he said.
As for government's peaceful agreement with leftist and Moro rebels, Duterte said in his speech that his administration is ""committed to implement all signed peace agreements in step with constitutional and legal reforms.""
The Duterte administration and the country's leftist movement had already held preliminary talks in the middle of June to set the tone for the resumption of the stalled formal peace process.
Negotiators for the Philippine government and leftist National Democratic Front said the two sides agreed on the agenda of their formal talks in the third week of July in Oslo.
The agenda includes the release of political prisoners, the mode of interim ceasefire and the way to speed up the negotiation process.
Even before he won the May 9 elections, Duterte promised to resume the peace process with the leftist rebels.
The government has been trying to forge peace with the leftist rebels since 1986, but the on-off talks have faltered many times in the past.
In mid-June, Duterte met with leaders of the Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in what was described as a ""meeting of a brother to a brother.""
Experts believed that Duterte must make sure to install the most capable and competent people in the government, otherwise it will be the same-old story.
Emil Jurado, columnist for the daily newspaper The Standard, wrote on Thursday that he doubted the promises to end criminality, illegal drugs and corruption within six months would be realized.
""The most seasoned law enforcers, like former Philippine National Police chief Panfilo Lacson, say this is simply not doable. Unless, of course, Duterte declares martial law or establishes a revolutionary government,"" he wrote.
Earl Parreno, a political analyst with the Institute of Political and Electoral Reforms, said one of Duterte's biggest challenges is how to manage the people's expectations.
""I have high hopes in his presidency, but I also recognize that there are very high risks,"" he said, adding that his hope ""is anchored on his sincerity and his bias in favor of the poor.""
""He raised the bar of expectations really high: can he really implement his anti-crime and anti-corruption policies programs in so short a time? ... Will the masses feel these changes? How is he going to deliver these changes that he promised to the masses. These are the challenges that he needs to address,"" Parreno said.

JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Foreign Ministry has continued its efforts to release seven Indonesian seamen held hostage by Abu Sayyaf terrorist group in southern Philippines.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi will hold a meeting with her Philippine counterpart Perfecto Yasay in Manila on Friday, spokesman of Indonesian Foreign Ministry Armanatha Nasir said on Thursday.
""The topic (of releasing hostage) will certainly be on the agenda in their meeting,"" he said.
The meeting will be held one day after Rodrigo Duterte was sworn in as the new Philippine president.
Minister Retno said whereabouts of the seven Indonesian hostages have been discovered, adding that all of them, which initially were divided into two groups, have been placed in one location.
Earlier this week, Indonesian Defense Minister Ryamizar Ryacudu met with his Philippine counterpart Voltaire Gasmin in Manila, agreeing to allow Indonesian military to enter into the Philippine territory in the next hostage situation.
The seven crews of Tugboat Charles 001 and Robby barge ship 152, were abducted in the Sulu Sea off southern Philippines on June 20.
That is the third abduction of Indonesian nationals in the waters between the two neighbors this year.
The incident took place after the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines reached an agreement last month to conduct a joint patrol to secure waterways on their borders.

c_135478201.htm|2016-06-30| Profile of 16th Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte|"

MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Rodrigo Roa Duterte took his oath of office as the 16th President of the Philippines in Malacanang, the presidential palace in Manila on Thursday.
The former Davao City Mayor won the Philippine presidential election held on May 9, with 16,601,997 votes, a lead of almost 7 million over the second-placer Manuel Roxas.
Following is the profile of Duterte.
Duterte, born on March 28, 1945, in Maasin of central Philippine province of Southern Leyte to Cebuano lawyer Vicente Duterte and Soledadad Roa, a school teacher. Duterte's father was once mayor of Danao in Cebu and then governor of the then undivided Davao province.
Duterte spent most of his elementary school year in Davao city, where he graduated in 1956. He finished his secondary education at the Holy Cross Academy of Digos in Digos City, Davao del Sur after being expelled twice from previous schools.
He received BA degree in political science in 1968 at Lyceum of the Philippines University in Manila. In 1972, he obtained a law degree from San Beda College of Law and passed the bar exam in the same year.
From 1977 to 1979, Duterte became Special Counsel at the City Prosecution Office in Davao City.
From 1979 to 1986, he climbed all the way from Fourth Assistant City Prosecutor to Second Assistant City Prosecutor.
He was elected vice mayor of Davao city in 1986 and then mayor in 1988. He was re-elected twice in 1992 and 1995.
In 1998, because he was term-limited to run again for mayor, he ran for the House of Representatives and won as Congressman of the 1st District of Davao City. In 2001, he ran again for mayor in Davao and was again elected for his fourth term. He was re-elected in 2004 and in 2007.
In 2007 he was elected vice mayor and his daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio, was elected as mayor. He has been Davao city mayor since 2010.
Under Duterte's governing, crime rates dropped drastically and he was nicknamed ""the Punisher"" for his crime-busting crusade there.
A 2015 Crime Situation Report released by the national police said that from 2010 to 2015, based on total incidents, Davao was top among 15 cities for murder, number two for rape and third for robbery.
With Duterte's efforts, the Davao city council imposed a prohibition on selling, serving, drinking and consuming alcoholic beverages from 01:00 until 08:00 each morning. He signed executive order which reduced the speed limits for all kinds of motor vehicles within the territorial jurisdiction of Davao City in the interest of public safety and order. He also made sure a comprehensive anti-smoking ordinance was carried out smoothly.
On Oct. 16, 2015, on the last day of filing for certificates of candidacy, Duterte did not show up. Martin Dino filed his intent to run for president under Duterte's party, PDP-Laban.
On Oct. 27, PDP-Laban made it official that Duterte will substitute as the party's presidential bet if aspirant Dino withdraws or is disqualified by the Commission of Elections (Comelec). Two days later, Dino officially withdrew his presidential bid and named Duterte as his substitute because of the possibility that Dino might be declared a nuisance candidate by Comelec.
During the presidential campaign period, the general public's crave for change has been very apparent, as they have grown to be disappointed at the country struck by poverty, corruption and public security crises.
Most of the voters interviewed by Xinhua said they want the new president to lead a fast developing country that is corruption free and an improved social security net.
Duterte embodied the hope of change to many Filipinos.
He has been leading most of the opinion polls since April. Some 33 percent of the voters said they would vote for Duterte in the final pre-election survey conducted by Social Weather Station.
The country's renowned polling body carried out the survey from May 1 to May 3 through face-to-face interviews with 4,500 validated voters nationwide with a sampling error margin of 1 point.
In some campaign activities, he vowed to wipe out corruption, drugs and criminality in three to six months if he wins the election.
His aggressive behavior and offensive language won him a lot of supporters, but aroused concerns and controversy as well.
The outgoing president Aquino has warned repeatedly the risk for the country to fall under a dictatorship if citizens voted Duterte.
Duterte is the first president to be nationally elected without a previous national position.
After Emilio Aguinaldo, Duterte is the second non-resident of Metro Manila to become president.
He was married to Elizabeth A. Zimmerman from 1973 to 2001. His current partner is Cielito Avancena.

c_135478075.htm|2016-06-30| Commentary: All eyes on new Philippine president for repairing China ties|"
by Xinhua Writer Sun Ding
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- As Rodrigo Duterte takes over as Philippine president on Thursday, sparks of hope have arisen for a rapprochement between his country and China after relations soured during his predecessor's tenure.
Yet whether those sparks can turn into flames heating up bilateral relations depends on whether Duterte can translate his positive signals into concrete and effective action.
The tough-talking former mayor of Davao City in southern Philippines has pledged sweeping policy changes on both domestic and diplomatic fronts.
Since winning election, he has made a string of overtures on Philippines-China relations, signaling that mending fences with China would be a foreign policy priority. He has said that China will be the first country he visits after taking office.
Such gestures are encouraging, particularly against the backdrop of the strained bilateral relations during the presidency of Benigno Aquino III, whose government repeatedly stoked tensions over the South China Sea.
In violation of Manila's agreement with Beijing to solve their South China Sea disputes via bilateral negotiations, the Aquino government unilaterally launched a compulsory arbitration case against China, not only undercutting its own trustworthiness but further complicating the row and the bilateral relationship.
Yet as many observers have noted, Duterte is also seeking U.S. support on the South China Sea issue among others and help in building the island country's regional clout.
So the new president still keeps his cards close to his chest. Whether he means what he has said about pursuing bilateral talks with China over the South China Sea disputes remains to be seen.
However, although the arbitration case has stolen much of the limelight on China-Philippines relations, the political farce staged by the Aquino government is far from being the whole picture of bilateral ties.
In 2015, China stood as the Philippines' largest source of imports second-largest trading partner, and third-largest export market. Bilateral trade reached 45.65 billion U.S. dollars, up 2.7 percent. Those figures offer just a glimpse of the close interaction between the two neighbors.
The incoming Philippine government has also voiced hopes for cooperating with China to develop the Southeast Asian country's infrastructure. Duterte has even reportedly said that he might seek joint exploration in the South China Sea, a principle China has long been advocating.
With China having rightly kept the door of dialogue open, the ball is in Manila's court. If Duterte's words about putting China-Philippines ties back on the right track are genuine, it is time for him to act.

MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- New Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to take a pragmatic approach to the South China Sea disputes with China, analysts here have said, noting that Manila will benefit a lot from a friendly relationship with Beijing.
Duterte was sworn in as the country's 16th president on Thursday.
The government of former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III filed an arbitration case against China in 2013, despite the agreement his country had reached with China on resolving their South China Sea disputes through bilateral negotiations.
China has refused to participate in the proceedings and declared that it will never recognize the verdict, stressing that the tribunal has no jurisdiction because the case is in essence related to territorial sovereignty and maritime delimitation.
""Every incoming president, every incoming administration has advantage of a fresh start,"" diplomat Lauro Baja said Wednesday. ""And by the pronouncements of Duterte, he seems to be more open to talking to China than his predecessor (President Benigno Aquino III).""
The South China Sea issue is ""the most sensitive"" foreign policy issue for Duterte and his administration, he said, adding, ""What I believe is this: there must be some lines of communication between China and the Philippines which does not exist now.""
Political science professor Benito Lim said Duterte is still in the process of ""trying to sort things out"" when it comes to the maritime disputes.
""There are two things that can only happen: either we talk to China or we continue this conflict. But we have to ask ourselves: what did we get from this long conflict? What's wrong if we talk to them?"" he said.
Lim noted that the new administration must exercise flexibility and have an open, clear mind if it wants to deal with China.
""It's about time we think seriously what exactly we want in that region instead of carrying a quarrel that is leading to something that is not constructive,"" he said.
Asked whether he will see a change in the relationship between Manila and Beijing, Lim said it depends on what the Duterte administration will do.
""The Department of Foreign Affairs and the people there should ask themselves the questions: What exactly do we want to do with the South China Sea issue? What are we going to ask for? We cannot say that it is ours ... Standoff again. There's nothing we can gain from that position. Nothing progressive will take place,"" Lim said.
""So our leadership need to assess and think very carefully what we need and what is most beneficial for the country if we sit down and talk,"" he said.
Duterte said last month that he wanted China to help improve the country's poor infrastructure by building a railway system that links the entire country.
Clarita Carlos, a professor with the University of the Philippines and president of the Centre for Asia Pacific Studies Inc, said Duterte is doing a ""brilliant"" strategy in dealing with China.
""What is important is we keep on talking and engaging constructively with China,"" Carlos said, predicting that the relations between the two countries will improve.

MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Rodrigo Duterte will take his oath of office on Thursday as the Philippines' 16th president.
On the campaign trail, the tough-talking former mayor from southern Philippines' Davao City has promised to ""kill"" drug lords and shame corrupt government officials and policemen suspected of colluding with criminals.
""We'll just make this country peaceful and we'll have the investments coming in,"" the 71-year-old said in a speech in Davao City Monday, warning he will not allow a Mexico-like narco-politics to reign in the country.
Fresh from last month's electoral victory, Duterte said he is ready to make sweeping policy changes during his six-year term. ""Change is coming,"" he said.
Duterte's real work of delivering promises begins on Thursday.
Aside from cracking down on rampant crime and eradicating corruption, Duterte will also have to grapple with a slew of problems including rapid population growth, poor infrastructure, inefficient bureaucracy and widespread poverty.
COMBATING POVERTY
A quarter of the country's 100 million people are poor, according to the Asian Development Outlook 2015, the annual economic publication of the Asian Development Bank released in March.
In the first half of 2014, poverty incidence was reported at 25.8 percent, compared with 24.6 percent in the same period in 2013, rising due to higher food prices and damage to livelihoods caused by typhoons, the report said.
Many of the people of Mindanao, where Duterte hails, continue to grapple with abject poverty.
While the Philippines has posted solid growth in recent years, the report said unemployment and underemployment ""remain high.""
""Even when the unemployment rate fell to 6.6 percent in January 2015, the lowest in 10 years, 2.6 million people remained jobless, nearly half of them aged 15-24 years, and a further 6.5 million were underemployed,"" the report said.
""Challenges are to accelerate infrastructure development and further improve the investment climate to regenerate more and better jobs for poverty reduction,"" the report said, adding that ""higher rates of investment are needed to build on recent gains and raise employment to reduce poverty.""
The report said investment has improved in the Philippines but still lags behind its Southeast Asian neighbors Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The country's net foreign direct investment inflows ""are modest,"" despite a 66 percent increase to 6.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2014, it said.
""A key constraint on growth stems from inadequate past investment in infrastructure,"" the report said. The Philippines ranked 95th out of 144 countries for the quality of its infrastructure in the Global Competitiveness Report 2014-2015 of the World Economic Forum.
Duterte's Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said infrastructure investment is priority, stressing the need to build railways, ports, airports, bridges and even cable cars to ease the monstrous traffic in Metro Manila. ""There will be connectivity of islands,"" he said.
Investors have indeed shun the Philippines, discouraged by poor roads, unreliable power supply and bad communication facilities, analysts said, adding that rampant corruption, unsolved violent crimes and decades-old insurgencies also mar the country's investment climate.
The ADB has predicted that the Philippines will see strong growth to continue this year and next, 6 percent in 2016 and 6.1 percent in 2017 respectively.
Richard Bolt, ADB country director for the Philippines, has earlier said that to sustain this growth ""will require the continuation of policies that support infrastructure and human capital development, improvements to the investment climate, and better governance.""
Duterte has vowed to promote contraceptives to prevent population explosion. ""I will reinstall the program of family planning. One. Two. Three. That's enough.""
Duterte has said he intends to amend some provisions in the 1987 constitution in a bid to transform the country into a federal state and lift the economic provisions that hamper foreign investors from investing in the country. ""Nothing short of a federal structure would give Mindanao peace,"" he said.
BOOSTING RECONCILIATION
Days before taking his oath this Thursday, Duterte sent his aides to Oslo, Norway to initiate peace talks with exiled leaders of the Left that has been fighting the government for decades. He has also met with Muslim rebels. ""I will call for inclusive talks with everybody, the Moros (Mindanao Muslims), the (Communist) rebels,"" he said.
Duterte has also decided to allow the burial of former President Ferdinand Marcos in the Heroes' Cemetery, saying this will bring healing to the country. ""I will allow the burial of President Marcos in the Heroes Cemetery not because he is a hero but because he was a Filipino soldier.""
Marcos died in Hawaii in 1989, his body, which was brought to the Philippines in 1993, is now on display inside a glass box in an air-conditioned crypt in the Marcos family's ancestral home north of Manila.
The past administrations have refused Marcos's body to be interred at the national heroes' cemetery, causing years of on-and-off political debates on whether the disgraced leader deserved a military honor and a plot in the hallowed ground.
Another bold move that Duterte wants to make is to free former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who is now detained at a hospital over plunder charges. Duterte, a lawyer, said Arroyo has been detained for four years without trial.
""She deserves to be released. She has been detained for so long, the trial delayed,"" Duterte said, adding Arroyo is a victim of slow justice.
CRACKING DOWN ON CRIMINALS
He stressed the need to reimpose the death penalty so he could hang criminals. ""When you kill someone, rape, you should die. I believe in retribution. Why? You should pay,"" he said.
Duterte's platform promises have won him more than 16.6 million votes, a resounding victory. Filipinos are pinning their hopes on Duterte, hoping for better and safer lives.
Duterte was first elected as mayor of Davao in 1988 and since then never lost an election until he became president.
""In Davao we were able to correct the so many errors along the way. I intend to do the same for the whole country. I will be harsh to the criminals. I will be strict to the wrongdoers but you'd always find something in me... especially those who are hopeless, helpless and defenseless,"" he said in his farewell speech Monday in Davao City where he was mayor for 22 years.
""I like the fact that he puts law and order first,"" said political analyst Clarita Carlos. ""No other activity can happen if there is rampant criminality. I want those drug lords to be put to jail. Business (sector) wants law and order for economic activity to prosper.""
Political science Professor Edmund Tayao said Duterte's plans are doable: ""All he is saying is that he doesn't mind using every means available in order to accomplish his promise of a crime-free society in as little as six month. That can be done.""

MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The administration of the President-elect Rodrigo Duterte is mulling to use cable cars to ease the crippling traffic in Metro Manila, his aide said Tuesday.
Incoming Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said in a TV interview that installing cable cars similar to that in Bolivia is""being seriously looking into"" by the Duterte administration.
In fact, he said that he has already started initial talks with the officials of the company that could build the project. He said that the cable cars can be operational in just 18 months.
He stressed the need to explore the space above since the roads that are criss-crossing the metropolis of 12 million people are clogged, making it more difficult to build more roads.
He said they are exploring the possibilities of installing cable cars that could bring commuters to the central business district of Makati City.
Duterte, who will assume power on June 30, said he will ask Congress for""special powers""to solve the debilitating traffic that has reached ""crisis"" proportions.

""I will reinstall the program of family planning. One, two, three (children), that's enough,"" he said, adding that the country's population, which has reached 100 million, is ""no longer realistic.""
Duterte said that the social workers must be proactive and they ""better shape up"" in implementing the program.
The 71-year old incoming president said that he is ready to face the Church.
The Philippines is 80 percent Catholic.
The Church has been opposing the use of artificial family planning and pushing for natural ways.
Duterte will assume the presidency on June 30 after receiving landslide votes in the May 9 elections.

MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the Philippines will focus on getting more modern helicopters and naval fast craft under its modernization program so that it can address internal security threats, local media reports on Friday.
The Standard, the country's daily English newspaper, quoted the incoming Philippine military chief-of-staff Ricardo Visaya, who said the weapons would be useful in dealing with the country's ongoing campaign against the Abu Sayyaf Group and New People's Army Threats.
Visaya said the incoming president Rodrigo Duterte wants to change the country's public security situation and make the whole country as safe as southern city of Davao, where he has been the mayor for most of the past two decades.
The military will prioritize acquisition of helicopters with night-fighting capabilities, said Visaya.
Lack of night-capable helicopters and fast craft, according to Visaya, hampered the military response when the Abu Sayyaf Group kidnapped four people in September last year. Two victims were beheaded in April and June, respectively.
Visaya also clarified that acquisition of equipment to beef up external defense capabilities will continue under the same modernization program. However, it will give way to acquisition of items needed for internal security operations.

BUENOS AIRES, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The disputes between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea should be settled through bilateral negotiation, Argentine expert Paola de Simone said Thursday.
Simone, a lawyer and political analyst from the University of Buenos Aires, told Xinhua that Manila's arbitration request over the issue ""violated the Philippines' commitment to the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC)."" That is, territorial and jurisdictional disputes should solved through friendly consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned.
The Philippines filed unilaterally in 2013 an arbitration case against China over the issue in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, the Netherlands.
Its move went against an agreement it reached with China in the mid-1990s on settling their disputes through negotiation. China has excluded maritime delimitation from compulsory arbitration in a declaration it made in 2006 in accordance with Article 298 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and has made it clear it will not accept or get involved in those proceedings.
Beijing insists that the Philippines must abandon its arbitration requests and return to bilateral negotiation.
The Philippines' President-elect Rodrigo Duterte has said he wishes to cultivate friendly relations with China and that he is open to direct talks concerning the South China Sea disputes.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Wednesday said China was willing to work with the new Philippine government to bring bilateral ties back on a sound track of development.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States likes to think of itself as a force for peace, law and justice, and the deployment of two aircraft carriers on a ""training mission"" in East Asia obviously backs up that aspiration. Or does it?
The timing of the operation -- just ahead of a ruling on South China Sea disputes -- is surely a deliberated one. The United States has dressed up the illegal, unilateral arbitration instigated by the Philippines as a noble act of homage to international law, while China's complete ambivalence toward irrelevant proceedings in The Hague is painted as disrespectful and a violation of that same international law.
Why the big show of strength now?
After countless promises not to take sides in South China Sea disputes, the arrival of the warships is presumably just another aspect of the ""peaceful resolution based on international law"" which the Obama administration has so consistently advocated.
Since the Philippines took it upon itself to open the arbitration, China has been drawn as the neighborhood bully who wants to militarize the region, but facts speak louder than hollow words and now more than 60 countries openly support China's stance. Could that be what all these warships, fighter jets and troops are about?
To the United States, these moves might look like ""peace, law and justice,"" but to everyone else they appear to be exactly what they are: militarization.
Even the Philippines smells a rat. On Tuesday, Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines' president-elect, said that he had asked the U.S. ambassador whether Washington would support the Philippines in a confrontation with China.
""Are you with us or are you not with us?"" asked Duterte.
""Only if you are attacked,"" the ambassador replied.
There's the rub. Is U.S. support for the arbitration really for the sake of the Philippines? Or is it all about China?
If there are any lessons to be learned from the past, the Philippines would know that bringing outsiders into any dispute invariably complicates matters, and never calms things down.
To paraphrase ""Game of Thrones,"" the Philippines may well ask themselves whether it is worthy ""to fight for the master who would never fight and die for you?""
As a new president preparing to assume office, Duterte would do well to give a thought to returning to the negotiating table. China will welcome him there.

MANILA, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Incoming Philippine President-elect Rodrigo Duterte vowed to implement the recommendations of the business community on how to make the economy more competitive during his six-year term of office which starts on June 30.
""I assure you we will study and review it and for now I would say I see nothing wrong with this. These are all doable. It's a matter of just doing it and implement it right away,"" Duterte told a business forum in southern Philippine Davao City.
Duterte, who will be sworn into office on June 30, reiterated that he will stamp out corruption and stressed the importance of law and order in order to rev up the economy.
""Corruption must stop. It makes me sick,"" he told the businessmen, warning that he will go after corrupt government officials, criminals and drug lords. ""I will not allow narco-politics in this country,"" he said.
""There can never be progress and development without law and order,"" Duterte said.
Businessmen flew to Davao City to attend the two-day business forum that started Monday. The businessmen came up with a 10-point policy recommendations that can help Duterte pursue his own vision of the economy under his six-year-term. Carlos Dominguez, Duterte's finance secretary, said the recommendations ""represent the best thinking of the (business) sector.""
Duterte and his economic team initiated the consultations to ensure a smooth-sailing relationship with the sector vital in sustaining the growth of the economy and the investment climate.
""The nation needs a vision that all Filipinos here and abroad can identify with. A mission and a masterplan that is not just a medium-term plan the we together can implement,"" said George Barcelon, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Barcelon said the businessmen ""analysed, dissected and argued"" on the 10-point socio-economic program of the Duterte administration during the two-day meeting.
""At the end of the day we came to a consensus of recommendations,"" he said. ""We hope that this (set of recommendations) will guide our country to better days. We look forward to you as a captain to call us to be on board.""
The businessmen crafted a ""masterplan"" that includes the need to implement a comprehensive tax reform package, to implement a national identification system, automation of business permits and licensing systems, improve internet and telecommunication services and improve the delivery of support systems to agriculture sector.
The businessmen also stressed the need to implement responsible mining, the need to map out a national strategy for industries and the need to improve transport networks and connectivity across the archipelagic country.

Duterte's economic team gathered about 300 businessmen in southern Philippine Davao City for a workshop aimed at fine-tuning the socio-economic agenda that the incoming administration plans to pursue. Duterte is expected to speak at the end of the two-day workshop Tuesday.
""We are going to be an inclusive (government), a government that spouses policies that have growth for everyone,"" incoming Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez told a news conference in Davao, stressing the need to prioritize projects outside Metro Manila.
""(We) need to execute projects in the countryside and thereby create jobs there. Those are the areas we need to prioritize,"" he said.
Dominguez added, ""We have 42 million people who are in the workforce. And the statistics show that about 5.7 percent of them are unemployed and around 18 percent of them are underemployed ... that's about 10 million who are unemployed and most of them as we know live in the rural areas. So, it's very important that jobs are created in those rural areas.""
""We are listening to the people,"" Dominguez said, noting that Duterte won by a landslide because Filipinos are yearning for a better life which they did not feel during the administration of outgoing President Benigno Aquino.
Duterte, who will take his oath of office on June 30, has vowed to stamp out corruption, criminality and reduce poverty in the country during his six-year term of office.
To lure foreign investors to the Philippines, Duterte has said that he is open to lifting the restrictions on foreign ownership of Philippine corporations in the Philippine constitution and that more transportation infrastructure projects will be undertaken ""in every region"" during his administration.
Specifically, he is looking at a Mindanao railway system in the southern Philippines.
Duterte's economic team has bared the economic policies that the Duterte administration plans to pursue.
The incoming administration will ""continue and maintain the current macroeconomic policies;"" however, the team said that ""reforms in tax revenue collection (in the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Bureau of Customs) efforts will be complemented by reforms within the bureaucracy of these tax collecting agencies.""
The team said the new administration will accelerate infrastructure spending by addressing, among others, major bottlenecks in the public-private partnership program while maintaining the target of setting aside 5 percent of the country's gross domestic product for infrastructure spending.
""(The Duterte administration) will ensure attractiveness of the Philippines to foreign direct investments by addressing restrictive economic provisions in the Constitution and our laws, and enhancing competitiveness of the economy,"" the team said.
The administration also vowed to ""pursue genuine agricultural development strategy by providing support services to the small farmers to increase their productivity, improve their market access, and develop the agricultural value chain by forging partnership with agribusiness firms.""
The economic agenda also includes unclogging the bottlenecks in the land administration and management system, strengthening the country's basic education system, improving the income tax system ""to make it progressive to enable those who earn little to have more money in their pockets,"" and expand and improve implementation of the conditional cash transfer program.
The Duterte administration said it plans to promote science, technology and the creative art ""to enhance innovation and creative capacity.""
Moreover, it said Duterte will strengthen the implementation of the responsible parenthood and reproductive health law ""to enable all, especially poor couples, to make informed choices on financial and family planning.""
Dominguez said the economic agenda of the Duterte administration ""is simply following what the electorate has spoken to us about,"" adding that Duterte got elected because ""he stood for peace and order, no crime, no drugs, no corruption and inclusive growth.""
Incoming Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia told a news conference that he predicts the economy to expand by at least 6.5 percent this year.
""Since it's the start of the new administration, we will have adjustment pains. It will not be smooth-sailing right away. There may be some adjustment hiccups,"" Pernia said.

The Front groups the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), with other leftist organizations.
The Philippine military said the NPA has estimated 4,000 members. The rebels have been fighting the government since 1969 in one of Asia's longest-running insurgencies.
The government has been trying to forge peace with the leftist rebels since 1986 but the on-off talks have faltered many times in the past.
Duterte, who won in the May 9 elections, will assume the presidency on June 30.

BUENOS AIRES, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' ongoing maritime dispute with China over the South China Sea must be resolved through reasoned bilateral dialogue, said a leading Argentine economist and academic.
Unilateral measures only serve to damage the relationship between the two countries, Gustavo Girado, head of the Buenos Aires-based Asia & Argentina Consultancy, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
In 2013, Manila decided to take its case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, a move that ""didn't seem to be the most appropriate, since the decade-old agreements between the two countries have established a proper means to resolve their disputes,"" said Girado.
The unilateral move ran counter to the commitments the Philippines made as a signatory of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), said the academic.
""The road the Philippines chose draws attention somewhat due to a number of factors which failed to justify that action, historic and political factors,"" said Girado.
""It's very clear that Chinese inhabitants were the first to name the region,"" he added.
On Wednesday, China again urged the Philippines to suspend its legal proceedings at the PCA and return to the negotiating table.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei made the remarks at a press conference, saying the door to bilateral talks will always be open.
""China will continue to be committed to a negotiated solution to the South China Sea dispute with the Philippines, based on historic facts and in accord with international law,"" he said.
Girado believes the dispute ""doesn't merit intervention by third parties,"" such as an arbitration court, which ""belongs to the last century.""
In 2014, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a Position Paper on the arbitration, saying that the essence of the subject matter of the case is territorial sovereignty over several maritime features in the South China Sea, which is beyond the scope of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) under which Manila initiated the arbitration.
China has repeatedly noted that since the 1970s, the Philippines has illegally seized by force maritime features of China's Nansha Islands in disregard of the UN Charter and the basic norms governing international relations, and this is ""the root and direct cause"" of the two countries' disputes over the South China Sea.
""It's appropriate for China not to take into consideration the resolution of arbitration, given the previous accord that allows for reaching a mutual agreement through peaceful, responsible negotiation,"" Girado said.
""Law of the Sea legislation precisely says that those who have a previous accord for bilateral resolution of disputes must take that route,"" he said.
With that in mind, said the academic, it seems ""clear and wise on the part of Chinese diplomacy not to take into account any eventual decision (issued by the PCA), because it doesn't take into account China's opinion.""
As to the likelihood of outside powers intervening in the dispute, Girado thought it's ""evident."" He explained that since U.S. President Barack Obama's first term, a policy has been established for the region, with the U.S. Navy's presence in a certain area in order to exert a degree of influence on matters of interest to the United States.
""It's a tremendously rich zone, through which half of the planet's maritime mercantile trade passes. I have no doubt there are concrete interests at play in the Filipino decision, which really calls one's attention,"" said Girado.
The academic underscored the need for a negotiated solution to the dispute, drawing parallels to Argentina's long-running conflict with Britain over the Malvinas Islands, known to the British as the Falklands.
Since the islands ""were usurped by the world's leading capitalist economy back in the year 1833, different interests have been at play to prevent Argentina, a developing country, from staking a claim to what belongs to it.""
In early June, China said it hoped the new government in the Philippines would return to the negotiating table.
After the Philippines' incoming Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay signalled that bilateral talks with China could help deescalate the dispute, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying noted that successive leaders from both sides have agreed in past meetings and documents to resolve the issue peacefully through direct talks.
""We hope the new government of the Philippines fulfills its pledges and resumes talks with China to properly handle disputes in a way that contributes to the sound and stable development of bilateral ties,"" said Hua.
The incoming president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has said he wants to promote friendly ties with China and that he is open to direct talks on the South China Sea dispute.

MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine experts on Monday urged incoming president Rodrigo Duterte to proceed with direct talks with China on the South China Sea immediately, saying the new administration need not wait for the decision of a tribunal to kick-start the talks.
Rod Kapunan, a columnist for the newspaper The Standard, said it may not be wise for the incoming Duterte administration to wait for a decision from an tribunal in The Hague which China will not recognize anyway.
""Once the court comes out with a decision, our position to reach a direct and peaceful settlement of our dispute with China would become more difficult,"" Kapunan told Xinhua in an interview.
""China has always been open for direct and peaceful negotiations but the conditions will not be the same after the decision,"" he said, warning that the decision might even force Beijing to stay away from the negotiating table.
""If you are going to negotiate directly and peacefully with China after the arbitration decision comes out, China will surely insist that there must be no reference to the court's decision,"" Kapunan said.
In 2013, the Philippines initiated an arbitration case against China over the South China Sea. China, which has declined to take part in the process, has said it will not recognize the court's decision.
For the direct talks to take off, Kapunan said the Duterte administration must scrap its Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) signed by the Philippines and the United States in 2014.
The expert also said that this pact ""locks the Philippines in a situation where we would be permanently girding for war with China"" and adopt a foreign policy that unmistakably serves the interest of the U.S. in the Asia and the Pacific.
""The best solution is first to scrap the EDCA and second to start the direct talks,"" said Kapunan, adding that EDCA stands in the way ""like a wall"" between the Philippines and China.
""For as long as we have foreign military bases in our soil, the country can never formulate its own independent foreign policy,"" Kapunan said.
""As a lawyer, Duterte could see the implication in allowing the re-installation of the U.S. bases. Other than providing no time limit for the American's stay, the agreement gave the U.S. the blanket authority to select the place and the number with a premium that our Senate would have to ratify it as mandated by our Constitution,"" Kapunan added.
Indeed, Kapunan said, ""The abrogation of EDCA is the easiest way (for the Duterte administration) to escape the dilemma.""
He said, ""President Benigno Aquino III knew that by bringing our dispute with China to the PCA (the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague) would give the U.S. the leverage to continue its provocative patrol in the South China Sea.""
By doing that, ""the perception about the naval presence of the U.S. in the South China Sea can never be doubted because the Philippines being strategically adjacent to China would forever seek the protective cover of the U.S.. In short, all these could lead the country to a possible proxy war with China,"" Kapunan said.
This explains why, Kapunan said, Duterte would have difficulty redrawing the foreign policy under his administration.
He further said, ""A decision to disallow the U.S. bases or to unilaterally drop the case could antagonize the U.S. because that would explode its continued presence in the South China Sea redundant. Nobody would believe that its continued patrol in the area is to secure the freedom of navigation. Rather, the whole military infrastructure it build would be exposed as a facade to contain China.""
Indeed, retired diplomat Alberto Encomienda told Xinhua in another interview that the new Duterte administration should proceed with talks with China on the sea disputes.
""You don't have to wait for the resolution of the arbitration case before starting conversations. You don't have to finish that arbitration. Nobody even knows when that will be finished,"" Encomienda said.
Assistant Foreign Secretary Charles Jose has repeatedly said that the Philippines will really have to go back to bilateral talks, though he pins hope on the arbitration court handing down a favorable decision.
In a television interview Monday, Jose said, ""we are now in the tail-end of the arbitration process.""
Duterte, who will be sworn into office on June 30, has said he would wait for the final decision of the court, but at the same time said that he will pursue bilateral talks with China if current efforts do not progress. He even said that he might explore possible joint exploration in the disputed South China Sea.
Duterte also said that the Philippines is not going to give up its rights to the Scarborough Shoal, or Huangyan Island.
But before 1997, the Philippines had never claimed sovereignty over Huangyan Island, and the international community had never raised any objection to China's sovereignty over the island as well.

MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine columnist on Saturday
called on the incoming Philippine government to drop a defense pact
between the Philippines and the United States, arguing it was
reducing the country into one big U.S. military base.

""For as long as we have foreign military bases on our soil, the
country can never formulate its own independent foreign policy,""
Rod Kapunan wrote in an article published on Saturday, calling the
foreign policy of outgoing Benigno Aquino's government ""a carbon
copy of the U.S. policy for the Asia-Pacific region.""

Manila and Washington signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation
Agreement in 2014, which allows the U.S. troops to build facilities
to store equipment in the Philippines, in addition to giving broad
access to Philippine military bases.

""As a lawyer, (incoming President Rodrigo) Duterte could see the
implication in allowing the reinstallation of the U.S. bases,""
Kapunan wrote in an English newspaper the Standard.

He called on Duterte to drop the defense pact, which he said
would be used as an example by future administrations to sign
agreements that would allow other countries to establish their own
military bases in the Philippines.

He slammed the Aquino administration for bringing the dispute
with China in the South China Sea to the Permanent Court of
Arbitration in The Hague, saying it would give the United States
the leverage to continue ""its provocative patrol in the South China
Sea.""

Kapunan pointed out that the defense pact has been unduly
stretched by the United States to allow it to conduct regular naval
patrol and reconnaissance flight in the disputed waters, and that
invoking freedom of navigation to conduct regular naval patrol
would lose its viability if the Philippines decides to scrap the
pact.

""Nobody would believe that its continued patrol in the area is
to secure the freedom of navigation. Rather, the whole military
infrastructure it built would be exposed as a facade to contain

MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III said Thursday that he remained hopeful of passage of the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) in the next Congress under the administration of incoming President Rodrigo Duterte.
""There is a long way to go, and many of us who worked so hard for peace are fearful, apprehensive and unsure. It is true that the culmination of our efforts has been delayed. Today, however, I ask you to remember and take strength from the progress we have made,"" Aquino said in a speech in the launching of the Government of the Philippines-Moro Islamic Liberation Front (GPH-MILF) Peace Process.
The passage of the proposed BBL is part of the peace agreement signed by the Aquino administration and the Muslim rebel group in March 2014. Its enactment did not push through due to many questionable provisions.
Aquino cited the importance of continuing the peace process with the MILF, including the approval of the BBL.
He said that from 2010 to 2015, total actual investments in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) amounted to 14.3 billion pesos (310.67 million U.S. dollars) as compared to 87.9 million pesos in 2010 and 6.58 billion pesos in 2015.
ARMM is the core territory for the proposed Bangsamoro region under the draft BBL.
Duterte has said that he would push for a federal government, covering also ARMM. His appointed leader in the House of Representatives said this would make the passage of the BBL moot and academic.

c_135423268.htm|2016-06-09| Spotlight: Philippine politicians, experts, opinion leaders call for independent foreign policy, bilateral talks with China on South China Sea issue|"
By Wang Wen and Yang Tianmu
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Politicians, international relations experts and opinion leaders from the Philippines on Wednesday called on President-elect Rodrigo Duterte to start bilateral talks with China on the South China Sea issue as soon as possible.
They noted that the forthcoming government needs not wait for a decision from an international tribunal in The Hague before talking to China.
The call was made as they gathered here to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the establishment of bilateral relations between the Philippines and China.
The call came as the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday issued a statement on settling disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea through bilateral negotiations.
RESUMING BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS
Speaking at the gathering, Francisco Tatad, a former senator, said ""What we should control at all times is our national interest. Let us remember that the maritime disputes were there when the Philippines and China decided to establish diplomatic relations.""
Tatad called on the Philippines to follow India's example to negotiate with China and talk about ways to improve the two countries' economic relations.
He reminded the audience that it was the Philippines who first did reclamation activities such as building airstrips in the South China Sea.
Alberto Encomienda, former secretary-general of Maritime and Ocean Affairs Center at the Department of Foreign Affairs, told Xinhua after the gathering ""You don't have to finish that arbitration. Nobody even knows when it will be finished.""
He said that the Philippines could even withdraw the case, and a withdrawal does not put the country to shame as long as it is in accordance with the country's vital interest.
""China has been for the negotiations all along, but from the beginning we are not,"" said Encomienda.
He eyed Durterte's recent meeting with Zhao Jianhua, the Chinese ambassador to the Philippines, as a good start for both sides.
Echoing Enconienda, Butch Valdes, former undersecretary of the Department of Education, told Xinhua that the Philippines will not have actual benefits even if the tribunal rules in favor of the country.
He stressed that the situation will be worse because a ruling from an international tribunal will only escalate tension in the South China Sea.
For her part, Aileen Baviera, a professor at the University of the Philippines, said bilateral talks with China ""can be an avenue for resuming the confidence-building process"" between the two countries.
Bilateral talks can also assure China that there is no intention to use arbitration and there is no intention to harm China's security interests, said Baviera.
FORMULATING INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY
Also on the occasion, they said it is high time that the Philippines formulates its own independent foreign policy.
""During (President Benigno) Aquino (III)'s first state visit to the United States, the phrase 'rule of law' was emphasized. Everything that came up as the Philippines' position on the South China Sea afterwards has something to do with 'rule-based' and 'legal framework.' But these are the rule basis determined by the United States,"" noted Encomienda.
He said again and again at the gathering that his country is in urgent need of an independent foreign policy.
Valdes, in addition, asked the forthcoming government to review the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) which the Aquino administration signed with the U.S. government in April 2014.
He believed the agreement such as EDCA should not have been signed by the president in an ""underhanded manner,"" rather it should have been sent to Senate for ratification.
""In the past three to four years, they (the U.S.) have made the country into a U.S. military base.""
Duterte, who will be sworn into office on June 30, has said he will wait for the final decision from the tribunal but also noted that he will pursue bilateral talks with China if current efforts do not progress.
He even said that he might seek possible joint exploration in the South China Sea.
Relations between China and the Philippines have soured during Benigno Aquino III's six-year rule.
The Philippines unilaterally initiated an arbitration case against China in January 2013 over the South China Sea issue with an international tribunal in The Hague.

MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Incoming Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will send his peace advisers to Oslo, Norway next week to start preliminary talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), the political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People's Army, the NDFP said in a statement on Wednesday.
""We are now preparing for the preliminary talks in Oslo next week to agree on the agenda for the resumption of peace talks in July,"" said Jose Maria Sison, chief political consultant of the NDFP, in a statement.
""We are ready to agree on the drafts of important documents for finalization and signing by the negotiating panels and for approval by the principals in July,"" said Sison.
The Leftist leader, who is based in the Netherlands, seems optimistic that the peace talks with the incoming administration will work out this time.
""There should never be any problems in the peace process that we cannot discuss and fix promptly, directly or through our emissaries. We have the necessary degree of rapport to exchange views and come to an agreement quickly in order to bring the peace process to a successful and happy conclusion,"" Sison said.
President-elect Duterte, who will be sworn into office on June 30, said he would send incoming peace adviser Jesus Dureza and incoming Labor Secretary Sylvester Bello and Hernani Braganza to Oslo to initiate the talks.
NDFP spokesperson Fidel Agcaoili said the NDFP has already fromed a five-member team that will talk with the Dureza and the peace emissaries.
Duterte has revived the peace talks in a bid to lure the rebels to return to the negotiating table.
He hopes to end Muslim and communist insurgencies during his six-year term of office. In fact, he immediately announced a week after the May 9 elections that he will name both Dureza and Bello to handle the peace process, describing both officials as ""men of expertise and wisdom.""
Indeed Dureza and Bello are not new in the peace process. Then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo appointed Dureza as Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process. Bello, for his part, took part in the government's peace negotiations from the time of then President Corazon Aquino up to the time of Arroyo.
The peace talks between President Benigno Aquino and the Left bogged down in 2013.
Many are optimistic about Duterte's overtures to talk with the Left. Duterte was Sison's student at the Lyceum University in the 1960s. In 1987, Sison fled to Europe to seek asylum as a political refugee soon after peace talks failed and has stayed abroad ever since.
It is estimated that the NPA has 4,000 members and it has been fighting the government since 1969 in one of Asia's longest-running insurgencies.

MANILA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate and House of Representatives adjourned sine die on Monday, signaling the close of the 16th Congress.
About 30 major laws, covering the economy, justice, agriculture, workers' welfare, health, and education, were approved during the three-year 16th Congress, Senate President Franklin Drilon said.
""Our collective efforts yielded a harvest of laws that will strengthen the economy, promote social justice and transform our country into one of the strongest and fastest growing economies in the world,"" he said in a speech.
Through the laws enacted by the 16th Congress, he said they are giving the next Congress and the administration of incoming President Rodrigo Duterte ""our present for the future.""
Among the major and controversial bills that were pending for a long time and only passed in the current Congress include the Philippine Competition Act, amendment to 50-year old Cabotage Law, full entry of foreign banks in the country, Customs Modernization and Tariff Act, and creation of the Department of Information and Communications Technology.
Despite the strong lobby of the Catholic Church and tobacco firms, the present Congress also passed the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law and the Sin Tax Reform Law, respectively.
""The 16th Congress may not be perfect,"" said Drilon, adding, ""However, the challenge that we must face head on is to protect our gains, and ensure the continuity of reforms, so that their fruits will be enjoyed not only by this generation, but also by the generations yet unborn.""
Drilon will continue to serve in the Senate as he has been reelected as a senator for another six-year term during the May 9 elections.
However, it is not sure if he could continue to remain as the Senate president when the 17th Congress opens in July.
On the other hand, House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, who has been reelected also as a congressman in Quezon City, Metro Manila, is likely not to retain the speakership in the next Congress as Duterte has given his support to Representative-elect Pantaleon Alvarez of southern Philippine province of Davao del Norte.

BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scholar on Thursday urged the Philippines to engage in bilateral talks with China to resolve their South China Sea dispute as its incoming administration expressed willingness to bring the maritime issues back to the negotiating table.
The attitude of the Philippines' new administration over the handling of the South China Sea dispute could serve as a start for seeking a bilateral solution to relevant issues, Zhou Yongsheng, professor with China Foreign Affairs University, told Xinhua in an interview.
On Tuesday, Perfecto Yasay, the Philippines' incoming foreign minister, stressed the new administration's willingness to pursue bilateral talks with China to resolve their dispute in the South China Sea.
On a separate occasion, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who was on a visit to Canada, expressed China's welcome if Manila sincerely wants to come back to the track of dialogue and negotiations.
The positive signals sent by the two sides could be used to help bring the South China Sea dispute back to the negotiating table, said Zhou.
He urged Manila to withdraw its unilaterally-initiated arbitration at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague regarding the South China Sea row.
Neither does the tribunal have the right to hear the case nor exercise jurisdiction, said the expert on Asia affairs. He illustrated his view by citing a declaration China made in 2006, which excludes a compulsory arbitration under the Article 298 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
The invalid arbitration case, which was brought up by outgoing President Benigno Aquino in 2013, has stirred up tensions in the South China Sea, in the Philippines' bid to cooperate with Washington's Asia-rebalancing strategy.
Aimed at building closer ties with the United States and Japan, Aquino's ""tricks"" by seeking arbitration over the maritime dispute have not helped solve the South China Sea row, but added risks to regional peace and security, Zhou said.
In contrast to the Aquino administration's reluctance to engage in dialogue with Beijing, the Philippines' incoming president Rodrigo Duterte has said on several occasions that he wanted to cultivate friendly relations with China, and confirmed that he was open to direct talks over the row in the South China Sea.
Duterte's policies are more open and pragmatic than those of his predecessor, Zhou said. ""Such kind of policies should be welcome,"" the scholar said.
As dialogue and negotiations are conducive to breaking the deadlock in Manila-Beijing relations, the professor suggested that the two sides step up engagement so as to resolve their dispute through dialogue as soon as possible.

c_135410717.htm|2016-06-03| Experts expect fresh start in Sino-Philippine relations under Philippine's new gov't|"
by Xinhua writers Yang Ke, Wang Wen
MANILA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The relationship between China and the Philippines, which has been strained by territorial disputes in the South China Sea, will experience a fresh start after incoming Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte assumes office, experts here said on Friday.
""Every incoming president, every incoming administration has the advantage of a fresh start,"" Lauro Baja, a former ambassador, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
Relations between China and the Philippines have soured during the six-year of outgoing President Benigno Aquino, whose government brought China to the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague over the disputes in the South China Sea.
Unlike Aquino, incoming President Duterte, who will assume office on June 30, has said that he is willing to engage China in bilateral talks on the issue.
Benito Lim, political science professor at the University of the Philippines and Ateneo de Manila University, said Duterte is the new president so he has to show that he is willing to accommodate and he is ready to talk.
""Very likely he looks like he is a very open minded person. There are two things that can happen: either we talk to China or we continue this conflict. The larger picture is we should ask ourselves: what did we get from this long conflict? What's wrong if we talk to them?"" Lim added.
Baja said that, by the pronouncements of Duterte, he seems to be more open to talking to China than the incumbent president (Benigno Aquino).
""What I believe is this: there must be some lines of communication between China and the Philippines, which does not exist effectively right now,"" Baja said.
Emil P. Jurado, a columnist, wrote in Thursday's Newspaper, The Standard, that the proposed bilateral talks with China seems to be a good move.
""I believe there's no substitute to dialogue when two countries have differences and disputes,"" said Jurado.
FRIENDLY OVERTURES
Earlier this week, Duterte hailed Chinese President Xi Jinping as a ""great president"" in a press conference in response to a message the Chinese president sent to congratulate him on winning the May 9 presidential elections.
In his message, Xi said that he hopes the two sides would ""get bilateral relations back on track of sound development.""
""A friendly, stable and sound China-Philippines relationship is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and the two peoples,"" Xi said.
Perfecto Yasay, Duterte's handpick for his foreign secretary, has sounded a conciliatory note towards thawing of bilateral relations between the two counties.
""I don't think that there is another way of resolving this dispute except talking to each other,"" Yasay told reporters this week.
""We certainly would like to make sure that we are able to resume bilateral talks because these are necessary,"" he added.
Baja said that he has noticed that China is receptive to the friendly overtures from the Philippine sides.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that he welcomed a possible warming of relations with the Philippines.
""The door of dialogue between China and the Philippines is always open,"" Wang told a news conference in Ottawa, Canada where he was on an official visit earlier this week.
""If the Philippines sincerely wants to come back to the track of dialogue and negotiations, we welcome that,"" he added.
INDEPENDENCE FROM AMERICA
Duterte told reporters earlier this week that the Philippines would not rely on the United States for long-term security, saying the Philippines is going to charter a course of its own.
""We will be charting a course of our own. It will not be dependent on America, and it will not be a line intended to please anybody but the Filipino interest,"" he said.
Baja pointed out that it was at the prodding of the U.S. that the Philippines opted for multilateral approach on the South China Sea issue, he noted, adding ""that shows that the U.S. is only after its national interest. If it is to the interest of the U.S. that we go bilateral with China, and of course they will agree.""
""Vietnam and China talk to each other and they were able to demarcate their line, their land border. They were able to come to an agreement also on their sea border, and they have a substantive trade and other relations,"" he explained.

BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The door of dialogue between China and the Philippines is always open as long as Manila desires to resolve any dispute through negotiations.

Philippine President-elect Rodrigo Duterte said his country would adopt an independent foreign policy from his predecessor. Incoming Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay also said he would like to resume bilateral talks with China.

Bilateral talks between the two countries could help untangle disputes in the South China Sea and break a deadlock in bilateral relations, as Yasay previously said. 

In fact, since China and the Philippines established diplomatic ties in 1975, bilateral relations had developed a lot with broadening cooperation in a wide range of areas.

During a state visit by then Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the Philippines in 1996, leaders of the two countries agreed to establish a relationship based on good-neighborliness and mutual trust toward the 21st century. They also reached an understanding based on ""shelving disputes and striving for joint development"" in the South China Sea.

In 2000, the two countries signed the ""Joint Statement Between China and the Philippines on the Framework of Bilateral Cooperation in the Twenty-First Century,"" which confirmed that the two sides would establish a long-term and stable relationship on the basis of good neighborliness, cooperation and mutual trust.

During then Chinese President Hu Jintao's state visit to the Philippines in 2005, both countries decided to establish a strategic and cooperative relationship aimed at peace and development.

During then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's official visit to the Philippines in 2007, both sides issued a joint statement reaffirming prior commitments of a cordial relationship between the two countries. 

On the South China Sea issue, successive leaders of both China and the Philippines had agreed that any maritime territorial dispute should be resolved peacefully through direct negotiations. The same commitment was made through the signing of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002.

It is because of the above-mentioned consensus that China and the Philippines had been able to effectively manage their disputes in the South China Sea for quite some time.

However, in 2013, the Philippine government led by outgoing President Benigno Aquino, initiated an invalid arbitration case against China involving the South China Sea, despite criticism from the international community.

Furthermore, to consolidate its role as a staunch supporter of the United States in realizing the later's ""rebalance in the Asia-Pacific,"" Manila has relentlessly wooed Washington by allowing the U.S. army to use its military bases and hold joint military drills.

The Aquino government's irresponsible and reckless actions have only worsened relations between the Philippines and China and increased instability in the region.

It is believed that the new Philippine government will be wise enough not to follow Aquino's path and return to the negotiating table. Doing so will contribute to the sound and stable development of China-Philippines ties.

BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- It has been widely speculated that the South China Sea will dominate the Shangri-La Dialogue, an Asia-Pacific defense and security summit opened on Friday in Singapore.
If so, the three-day meeting, which gathers military brass, intelligence officers and civilian leaders and promises to play a constructive role in regional security, will be another platform hijacked to make a fanfare of the maritime disputes.
Around the South China Sea, another negative development is that a few, particularly non-claimants, have been busy expanding presence and flexing military muscles around the South China Sea, as an international arbitration tribunal in The Hague prepares to deliver a ruling in the next few months over a case about the issue unilaterally lodged by Manila in 2013.
This adds to the worry that outside interference, which stems from various self-interests, has become an increasingly serious menace to stability in the South China Sea.
For example, the United States has conducted several so-called ""freedom of navigation"" operations by closely flying or sailing past South China Sea islands, blatantly violating China's sovereign and security interests.
In the meantime, the U.S. military made a series of harsh rhetoric on the issue. During his speech at the U.S. Naval Academy at the end of last month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the Pentagon's best weapons will be deployed to the Pacific region.
The words and deeds, with an obvious intention to create a volatile situation to help Washington preserve hegemonic presence in the Asia-Pacific region, will embolden certain claimants to make hot-headed moves on the issue.
These claimants should be reminded that if a confrontation between the United States and China whose sovereignty over the South China Sea islands is backed by both legal and historical facts should take place, regional countries will face a Cold War dilemma of picking sides between the world's two largest economies. To avoid such agony, they should be work together for common development and prosperity.
In fact, before the recent disturbances struck, the South China Sea situation had been generally peaceful thanks to Beijing's exercise of restraint and concerted efforts of most countries in the region.
Despite the territorial rows between China and other claimants, freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea has never been a problem. China also views the waters as being vital to global trade and its own development.
The good old time has proven that Beijing and other claimants, whose security and development interests are intensely interwoven, are capable of settling the disputes by themselves.
Successive leaders of claimant countries have agreed in their meetings and political documents that the South China Sea disputes should be resolved peacefully through direct negotiations. This stance is also stated in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.
What's heartening is that some positive signs have appeared. Among them, the incoming Philippine Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay has said bilateral talks between the Philippines and China could help untangle the disputes in the South China Sea.
""There is no other way but to go bilateral,"" he said. The remarks were welcomed by the Chinese sides. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a visit to Canada that ""the door of dialogue between China and the Philippines is always open.""
It is very true that for the South China Sea disputes to be untangled as soon as possible and for the busy patch of water to remain permanently peaceful, outsiders should withdraw their meddling hands and allow the parties directly involved to give their wisdom and pragmatism a full play.

MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The incoming administration of Philippine President-elect Rodrigo Duterte and the leftist rebel group will hold ""preliminary talks"" by middle of June to set the tone for the resumption of the 5-year stalled formal peace process, rebel officials said Thursday.
Fidel Agcaoili, National Democratic Front chair on human rights committee, said their group will meet with the incoming peace officials of the Duterte government led by Jesus Dureza in Norway, the third party facilitator in the peace talks.
""One of the things to be discussed (in the preliminary talks) is the release of political prisoners,"" he said.
There are 543 consultants and members of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front who have been languishing in jails, he said.
Jose Maria Sison, founding chairman of the Communist Party of the Philippines, told Manila-based journalists via Skype, that they would negotiate for an indefinite ceasefire with the government after the release of the political prisoners.
""We hope to arrive at a sort of truce in the coming days. There's still a war going on and we cannot expect prim and proper behavior on either side. I cannot tell the army to stop because I'm not yet in Malacanang,"" Duterte told reporters in an interview Tuesday.
Even before he won in the May 9 elections, Duterte promised to resume the peace process with the leftist rebels. He also invited Sison to come to the Philippines to discuss the revival of the peace talks.
Earlier this week, incoming Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello confirmed that he and incoming peace process adviser Jesus Dureza will be flying to Oslo on June 13 to start preliminary talks with communist rebels in order to end the insurgency.
Sison said he would return to Manila after Duterte's assumption to office, either July or August, his first since his exile to the Netherlands in 1987.
In February 2011, the Aquino administration held a formal peace negotiation with the National Democratic Front, the political front of the rebel group, in Norway, which later bogged down.
In 2013, the government and the National Democratic Front tried to revive the talks under a special track, but this did not succeed after the rebel group demanded for the release of all the political prisoners before continuing the negotiation.
The Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front has been waging war against the Philippine government for over four decades.

MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Incoming Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has urged his cabinet members to tighten belt, embrace austerity measures and live simply like ordinary Filipinos, his aides said Thursday.
Judy Taguiwalo, Duterte's chosen social welfare secretary, told reporters in Davao City that Duterte made it clear to his Cabinet members to live a frugal lifestyle and not to waste public funds.
""(He said) no luxury vehicles, take economy class (flights), and don't use government funds for junkets,"" she said.
Incoming Press Secretary Salvador Panelo said that Duterte deemed it ""very important"" to pursue austerity measures during his six-year administration.
Panelo said the cabinet members ""are all 100 percent agreeable"" with Duterte's policy.
Incoming Education Secretary Leonor Briones said Duterte also against the so-called pork barrel, a perk that members of Philippine Congress enjoyed in the past administrations.
Briones said Duterte does not want pork barrel. ""He said that he would abolish Congress (if it persisted),"" Briones said.
Duterte has marked government bureaus that he tagged as ""most corrupt,"" including customs, internal revenue, immigration and land transportation office.
He has also ordered his economic advisers to make sure that economic progress will trickle down to the poor.
Ernesto Pernia, incoming chief of the National Economic and Development Authority, told reporters that Duterte's administration will make sure that the high economic growth will be maintained.
Gross domestic product of the Philippines grew 6.9 percent in the first quarter of 2016, while the poverty rate in the country with a population of more than 100 million remains at more than 20 percent.
""So our policy would be to make sure that economic growth is more pro-poor, more biased toward the lower-income groups,"" Pernia said.
Duterte has repeatedly stressed that he will be harsh when it comes to corruption and even make sure that all the people to be working for him will also practice austerity.
Duterte has told reporters that only finger foods will be served during his oath-taking ceremony at the Malacanang presidential palace on June 30.

MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President-elect Rodrigo Duterte caused a social media storm on Wednesday when he trivialized media killings in the country by saying that journalists are paid hacks and resort to irresponsible reporting.
""It's not because you're a journalist you're exempted from assassination if you're a son of a bitch,"" Duterte told a press conference in Davao City Tuesday night, adding that journalists get killed because they take bribes and takes sides or excessively attack people.
A crime reporter was shot dead in Manila last week, becoming the 176th journalist slain in the line of duty since 1986 and the 34th under the watch of President Benigno Aquino III.
Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma said at the Presidential Palace in a statement Wednesday ""We deplore the proposition that some journalists may have been assaulted or killed in view of their alleged involvement in media corruption.""
Coloma added ""It is the duty of the government to arrest, prosecute and punish those responsible for violence against members of the media.""
""We recognize the vital role played by journalists as purveyors of information in a democratic society. As citizens, they have a fundamental right to due process and equal protection of the laws of the land,"" Coloma's statement read.
The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said in a statement ""It is appalling that President-elect Rodrigo Duterte should justify the murder of journalists in the country by playing the corruption card.""
The union said that while corruption can be a possible cause of media violence, ""it is a totally different thing to present this as a justification for taking life.""
""Murder is no joke. Neither is press freedom,"" the union said, adding that Duterte's 'crass pronouncement not only sullies the names and memories of all 176 of our colleagues who have been murdered since 1986.""
The union said Duterte ""has also, in effect, declared open season to silence the media, both individual journalists and the institution, on the mere perception of corruption.""
Lawyer Romel Bagares, executive director of non-governmental organization Center for International Law, said Duterte's statement ""only serves to justify and perpetuate impunity.""
""In a country that has become one of the most dangerous places on earth for journalists, it will only serve to embolden, rather than deter, those who kill without compunction,"" Bagares said.

MANILA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- President-elect Rodrigo Duterte unveiled on Tuesday his Cabinet, which has been 80 percent filled up, and gave the people snippets of the kind of government that he envisions during his single, six-year term.
Duterte, 71, was proclaimed by the joint session of Congress on Monday as the winner in the May 9 elections, and he will take his oath as the country's 16th president on June 30.
""They are all men of integrity and honesty,"" Duterte told a nationally televised news conference from Davao City, referring to the members of his Cabinet which included loyal supporters, retired military and police officers and former Cabinet members who served in previous administrations.
""It's really an inclusive government,"" he said, adding that he made sure that all sectors are represented in his Cabinet.
He said he personally picked the officials who will head the three government bureaus he perceived to be corrupt, the Bureau of Customs, the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Land Transportation Office.
""I assured the country and the business community that I will level, really level the playing field. I just give guidelines and I will not micromanage. I just want to make sure that people will not complain,"" he said.
However, he said he made clear to the Cabinet members that he does not want to see people queuing and that ""I don't want people spending money when dealing with the government. I just want honesty and good faith in dealing with the public.""
As expected, Duterte again sent a strong message to drug lords: ""The order is dead or alive.""
He also warned that he will tap the Army in the anti-drug campaign, saying that some policemen, including police generals, are corrupt and involved in the rampant spread of illegal drugs in the country.
""I will be harsh on corruption. I will be harsh,"" Duterte stressed, saying Filipinos are tired of corruption in government.
""Do not destroy my country because I will kill you. Do not destroy the youth of the land, our children, because I will kill you.
At the same news conference Duterte said he named ""proven workers"" that he can trust and work with in his Cabinet.
Duterte named as his Defense Secretary retired army general, Delfin Lorenzana, who was the former Philippine military attache to Washington.
Duterte also named Perfecto Yasay as acting secretary of foreign affairs. Yasay served as securities and exchange commission chief during the administration of former President Fidel Ramos.
Duterte also named former military's chief of staff Hermogenes Esperon as his National Security Adviser.
Chief Superintend Ronald de la Rosa will head the Philippine National Police.
Duterte also named lawyer Salvador Medialdea as his executive secretary, while another lawyer, Salvador Panelo, will be the press secretary and presidential spokesman.
He also named his long-time friend Carlos Dominguez to be his finance secretary. Other appointees include Jesus Dureza to head the peace process.
""I need young men but I need men of expertise and wisdom,"" Duterte said.
The tough-talking lawyer Duterte, who is currently the mayor of Davao City, the Philippines' biggest city, is the first president to hail from the southern Philippine Mindanao Island.
Duterte won on a campaign promise to target rampant crime by killing criminals, especially drug dealers, and restoring death penalty. He said solving traffic gridlock and waging war against crimes remain a priority.
Duterte has never held a national position before, which made him the first president to take a huge leap from being a local chief executive of Davao City for 21 years to the highest position in the land.
In 1986, former Philippine President Corazon Aquino appointed him acting vice mayor of Davao City following the ouster of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, a local post he held until 1988. He was elected Davao City mayor for 3 three-term periods, from 1988 to 1998, 2001 to 2010, and 2013 to 2016.
When term limits hindered his seeking the mayoral post, Duterte served as the city's first district representative from 1998 to 2001 in the House of Representatives. Afterwards, he became vice mayor from 2010 to 2013 to his daughter, Sara Duterte.
At one point, he spurned plans to hold the joint military exercises between the Philippine and U.S. forces in Davao. He also publicly denounced the U.S. agents for spiriting out from a Davao hospital an American whose limbs were severely injured after a bomb exploded inside his hotel room.

Presumptive Philippine president-elect Rodrigo Duterte vowed to restore death penalty in his country, according to his speech on Monday. (Xinhua/Stringer) 
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A joint session of the Philippine Congress on Monday proclaimed Rodrigo Duterte as the new Philippine president, over 20 days after the May 9 elections.
Duterte, 71, will take over from President Benigno Aquino on June 30 as the country's 16th president.
Both houses of the Congress, which is tasked by the Constitution to canvass the votes for the president and vice president finished Friday canvassing returns and results showed Duterte has won 16,601,997 votes.
Duterte had a lead of almost 7 million votes over second-placer Manuel Roxas, the candidate endorsed by Aquino, in a hotly contested election.
Duterte is the first president who hails from Mindanao in the southern Philippines. At 71, he is also the oldest to assume the presidency.
Maria Leonor Robredo, 51, a member of the House of Representatives, won the vice presidency with 14,418,817 votes or 263,473 votes ahead of her closest rival Sen. Ferdinand Marcos, who got 14,155,344.
Duterte, who earned the ""The Punisher"" reputation for his iron-fisted rule as mayor in the southern Philippine city of Davao, was elected on a platform of reducing rampant criminality, including promises of mass killings of suspected criminals, drug dealers, the restoration of the death penalty with hanging as the preferred mode of execution, and an overhaul of law enforcement agencies.
Duterte has also pledged to stamp out corruption, vowing to nail tax evaders and smugglers in the Philippines, saying widespread corruption in the country is contributing to increased poverty.
""There's so much expectation with the presidency of Duterte,"" said political analyst Edmund Tayao in an interview. Duterte vowed to reduce crime in six months.
""It's a protest vote,"" Tayao said, adding that Filipinos were fed up with the current administration's inability especially to curb rampant criminality in the country.
Tayao said people voted for Duterte because they think he has the guts to implement any measure even if it's unpopular.
""This was the message that reached the people -- a tough no-nonsense president, a tough leader,"" said Tayao.
Duterte, who stays most of the time in Davao, did not attend the proclamation ceremony at the House of Representatives in Manila. He told reporters over the weekend that he is busy completing the members of his Cabinet.
Aside from rampant criminality, he will also have to grapple with a slew of problems including reducing unemployment and under-employment rates, improving the country's investment climate, corruption, policy instability and inadequate infrastructure.

MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine's incoming government has said it would include a family planning policy into its economic agenda to control the country's population growth, local media reported on Tuesday.
""We are determined to speed up the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law, a component of the incoming administration's economic agenda,"" the country's economic planning secretary designate Ernesto Pernia has told a local television.
He said family planning and population control is a poverty reduction measure. The lastest census showed that Philippine's population has reached over 100 million in 2015. And the poverty rate in the country stands at more than 20 percent.
Pernia said that, based on surveys, young couples want access to family products and programs.
""The goal of the (incoming president Rodrigo) Duterte administration's economic roadmap is inclusive growth, which we are now calling poverty and inequality-reducing growth,"" the Philippine Star, a daily newspaper, quoted him as saying.

MANILA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Incoming Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said he would allow the burial of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery, saying the issue has long divided the nation.
""I will allow the burial of President Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani not because he is a hero but because he was a Filipino soldier,"" Duterte told reporters in southern Philippine Davao City on Monday.
He said Marcos's formal interment in the Heroes' Cemetery ""can be arranged immediately.""
Duterte, 71, has yet to be officially declared winner of the May 9 elections, but a vote count by a watchdog accredited by the Commission of Elections showed he is 6 million votes ahead of his closest rival. He will formally assume office on June 30.
""I am sure that I would erase from among our people one hatred,"" he said.
Indeed, the issue of the former leader's burial remains unresolved and continued to be a divisive issue in the Philippines.
Philippine President Benigno Aquino, whose six-year, single term ends in June, has not allowed military honors to be given when Marcos is buried, saying it would be ""the height of injustice to render any honors to that person who was the direct mastermind"" of the suffering of the many victims of the country's martial-law years.
Aquino is the son of the late President Corazon Aquino and Senator Benigno Aquino, a known political foe of Marcos who was assassinated in 1983 upon returning to the Philippines.
The assassination, which was blamed on the dictator, sparked a series of rallies that culminated in a civilian-backed military uprising that ousted Marcos and swept Corazon Aquino to power in 1986.
Marcos died in 1989 in Hawaii. His body, which was brought back to the Philippines in 1993, is now on display inside a glass box in an air-conditioned crypt in the family's ancestral home north of Manila.
The Marcos family, pleading for an ""honorable burial,"" had lobbied the government for Marcos' embalmed remains to be interred at the Heroes' Cemetery in Manila.
The renewed call to grant Marcos a hero's burial had met resistance from anti-Marcos groups, resurrecting decades of on-and-off political debate on whether the disgraced leader deserves a military honor and a plot in the hallowed ground.

MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Just two days after claiming presidential victory, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte unveiled possible members of his cabinet as well as possible policies in a move to gain confidence from the public.
During campaign period, public's desire for change has been very high due to long-standing poverty, corruption and public security crises. To them, the 71-year-old mayor embodied the hope of change.
""Duterte is a strong-willed leader with outstanding track record in Davao, and he can address the now bad peace and order situation, huge rich-poor gap and rural development and infrastructure needs,"" said columnist Wilson Lee Flores.
Flores' views are shared by many, but some analysts have warned of danger of blind optimism. They said the presumptive president will bring change to the country, but it is premature to say how big or radical the change may be.
""The emotional voters fail to see Duterte has only offered vague and generic promises,"" said Richard Heydarian, professor at De La Salle University.
Heydarian, also a political adviser, said Duterte has raised public's expectations so high that he has to find some way to manage them.
Duterte became Davao City mayor in the 1980s and has since held the post for seven times.
Once notorious as the nation's ""murder capital"" in southern Mindanao region, Davao is now one of the country's safest cities under his rule.
During the presidential campaign, Duterte made promises to wipe out corruption, criminality and drugs in three to six months after he takes office.
Duterte clearly understands the importance of reassuring the public of his competence in sustaining current economic growth as well as his sophistication in handling multifaceted domestic issues.
Prior to the election, investors have expressed concerns over his lack of economic experience. But Wednesday's markets showed otherwise.
The country's benchmark stock index closed 3.09 percent higher on Wednesday, posting highest close since August 2015. The Philippine peso rose the most in six weeks and the currency also strengthened versus all of its ten Asian peers.
Duterte has hinted his cabinet appointees, some being seasoned business people and technocrats.
He told reporters in Davao Monday that he is eyeing hotel owner Carlos Dominguez to be his secretary at the Department of Finance or Department of Transportation and Communications.
Duterte also said he would appoint as his peace adviser his former classmate and fellow Davaoeno, Jesus Dureza, who served as the peace adviser and press secretary of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
Other possible cabinet appointees include Senator Alan Peter Cayetano to head the Department of Foreign Affairs, and former Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Hermogenes Esperon Jr.
Dominguez and Dureza are very experienced, according to Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist at BDO Univank Inc. in Manila.
""Their expertise is more of grass-root economics, they know the local front, what is lacking on the ground,"" Ravelas said.
""Duterte is a nationalist who will uphold an independent foreign policy, which can make the country good friend to all major powers,"" said Flores, who added that the country would benefit more economically in this way.

The Davao City mayor, who is leading the partial unofficial election results, told reporters that he has yet to talk to other people whom he would consider to be part of his Official Family.
In dialogues with businessmen prior to the May 9 elections, Duterte said that he would appoint as his peace adviser his former classmate and fellow Davaoeno, Jesus Dureza, who served as the peace adviser and press secretary of former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
He was also eyeing hotel owner Carlos Dominguez to be his secretary at the Department of Finance or the Department of Transportation and Communications.
Duterte was also considering his running mate Senator Alan Peter Cayetano to head the Department of Foreign Affairs after the one year ban for losing candidates. Cayetano has been trailing behind other vice presidential bets Leni Robredo and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. based on partial, unofficial count of the election watchdog.
The incoming president said that Leoncio Evasco, his chief of staff and former member of the leftist New People's Army, would stay beside him. But he did not mention yet the position he would give to Evasco, incumbent mayor of Maribojoc town in central province of Bohol.

 China Voice: Next Philippine leader faces new South China Sea horizon

"|"
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Winner of the Philippine presidential election will have a fresh chance to find a win-win solution to his country's issues with China in the South China Sea.
An unofficial, partial tally of votes at 2:00 a.m. Tuesday indicated that the next president could be Davao city mayor Rodrigo Duterte.
Among various challenges awaiting the new Philippine leader is finding a proper solution to South China Sea disputes. It is a chance to cast aside his predecessor's unilateral practices and bring the matter back to the negotiating table, which can only be good for Sino-Philippine relations in particular and regional peace and stability in general.
During his campaign, Duterte did not rule out talks with China.
By unilaterally initiating arbitration over the South China Sea, the Philippines has stirred up trouble and aggravated the situation. Filipinos may have come to realize that a die-hard confrontation will do no one any good.
Since 1949, China has solved boundary issues with 12 of its 14 land neighbors via consultation. China and Vietnam have delineated the maritime boundary in the Beibu Gulf through negotiations.
It is difficult to predict what attitude the new Philippine leader will take, and whether Philippine politicians will follow through with their promises, but the chance to set a course toward a positive and lasting solution should not be allowed to drift by.
The door for dialogue remains, as it always has been, open.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- For whoever wins the Philippine general election on Monday, improving the people's well-being is undoubtedly a top priority, and that effort would be unnecessarily harder without a healthy relationship with China.

As the world's second largest economy, and the No. 1 trade partner to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which the Philippines is an important member, China has made remarkable contributions to the development of the dynamic region, consisting of mostly emerging economies.

With the China-proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) breaking ground with new projects, and the gradual gathering of momentum by the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road program, part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, promising new opportunities are presented for regional countries including the Philippines.

Unfortunately, over the past six years, under President Benigno Aquino's rule, the Southeast Asian country has increasingly fallen under the influence of warmongers in Washington and Tokyo, while achieving little in real benefits and progress for its people.

Respectively seeking ""re-balance towards the Asia-Pacific,"" a strategy widely interpreted as a move to contain a prospering China, and the expansion of military power, the United States and Japan have made a use of unresolved territorial disputes in the South China Sea as a perfect excuse to create tension and insert their meddling hands.

The Philippines' role in the once peaceful region, in the eyes of hawkish politicians in Washington and right-wing extremists in Tokyo, is clearly just a pawn, as they are only interested in enthusiastically pushing for military bases and arms sales to the country.

Aquino was naive to believe that he could use Washington and Tokyo's influence to gain an upper hand over China in the South China Sea, as China is a sincere partner of dialogue and cooperation in the region. Meanwhile, the meddlers will be delighted to see grudges and confrontations, even though they are at the cost of the Filipinos.

It was also a serious strategic misjudgment for Aquino to distract ASEAN from focusing on economic and social development with bilateral disputes, which creates unnecessary division and hinders the regional bloc's essential task.

Manila could have its voice better heard through a strong and independent ASEAN, while being a puppet of Uncle Sam and trying to manipulate the bloc will definitely be unhelpful.

With solid plans like the Belt and Road Initiative and the AIIB aimed at regional cooperation, development and integration, China has proved by action its true aspiration for win-win cooperation and common prosperity.

It is highly advisable for the new administration in Manila to see clearly who is their true friend, and to join Beijing in dialogue and cooperation to tackle their disagreement, thus safeguarding peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific.

            "|" 
Â Â Â Â MANILA, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- The leftist New People's Army (NPA) on Tuesday released an Army junior officer, who was abducted by the rebels about two months ago following a fierce firefight in the southern province of Compostela Valley, the Philippine military said. 
Â Â Â Â Lt. Vicente Cammayo was released by the rebels to Davao City vice mayor Sarah Duterte Tuesday morning in the Agusan del Sur province, said Ernesto Torres, spokesman of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. 
Â Â Â Â Cammayo was later brought to the headquarters of the militaryâs Eastern Mindanao Command in Davao City for debriefing, Torres said. He was taken as a prisoner of war on Nov. 7 last year in a clash that also left two soldiers and a rebel dead. 
Â Â Â Â ""The release of Lt. Cammayo is a result of the concerted efforts of the local government officials, family of Lt. Cammayo and the security forces in the area,"" said the spokesman. 
Â Â Â Â The local officials negotiated for Cammayo's release while the military applied pressure by waging rescue operations to recover the officer. 
Â Â Â Â Torres said the military was not involved in the negotiations for the soldier's freedom. 
Â Â Â Â ""We maintain that the military was not involved in any negotiations, but rather an intensified rescue operation mission has been mapped out upon his abduction,"" he said. 
Â Â Â Â At the same time, the official said that there was no reason for the military establishment to be grateful with the left-wing rebels over the release of Cammayo, adding that the abduction itself is against the law and the rebels should be held accountable for it. 
Â Â Â Â ""There is no reason for anybody to be grateful to the NPA for the release of Lt. Cammayo. The release of Lt. Cammayo is not an act of goodwill. Being a clear criminal act, those who are behind the abduction must be held responsible under a legitimate justice system and we shall continue our vigorous military operation to pursue the abductors,"" said Torres. 
Â Â Â Â The 5,400-strong NPA has been waging a guerrilla war against the government since its founding in late 1960s. It halted peace talks with the government in 2003, irritated by the administration's inaction to remove it from the U.S. government's list of international terrorist organizations.

TOKYO, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte wrapped up his visit to Japan on Thursday, seeking economic support from Tokyo but still vexing its long-time ally of U.S. with his blistering remarks.
During Duterte's three-day visit, Japan and the Philippines have agreed to enhance cooperation, with Tokyo in an apparent effort to woo Manila back to ""the U.S.-Japan camp.""
The two sides signed a series of cooperation documents, including Japan offering yen loans to improve the Philippines's maritime safety capabilities and help it revitalize agriculture business.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who expressed his intention to deepen cooperation with Manila in fighting terrorism, said Japan would provide high-speed boats and other equipment to enhance the Philippines' anti-terrorism capabilities.
For his part, the Philippine leader pledged a peaceful solution to the South China Sea issue, upholding in general his stance expressed earlier during his visit to China.
Duterte has reached consensus with the Chinese leaders during his tour to Beijing, which is focused on cooperation and bringing the South China Sea issue back to the correct track of bilateral negotiation and consultation.
He said at the Philippine Economic Forum in Tokyo Wednesday that the Philippines would pursue an independent foreign policy.
""I want friendship of everybody,"" he said, adding that he looked to ""be friends with China.""
He also told a press conference after his meeting with Abe that he would seek peaceful settlement of maritime disputes including the South China Sea issue.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said at a press briefing in Beijing Thursday that Duterte's recent remarks during his visit to Japan accord with the consensus he reached with Chinese leaders during his China visit last week.
Besides the South China Sea issue, the outspoken Philippine leader also baffled Japan with his comments on the United States.
According to local reports, Japan had hoped to bring the Philippines back to ""the U.S.-Japan camp"" through direct communication with the president during his stay in Japan.
However, Duterte continued to voice his dissatisfaction with Washington. ""I want to prove to everybody, the Philippines has a dignity,"" he said, reiterating that the United States treated his country like ""a dog on a leash.""
He also wanted all foreign military troops out of the Philippines ""probably in the next two years.""
Mentioning the U.S. colonial control of the Philippines over half a century, Duterte said he would pursue an independent foreign policy and the Philippines will ""survive"" without U.S. assistance.
Former Philippine president Benigno Aquino III signed an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the U.S. in 2014, which allowed the return of U.S. troops to the Philippines after the country expelled U.S. soldiers in the 1990s.
Duterte, who took office in June, has reportedly talked about abrogating defense agreements with the U.S. over the past two months.
""For Japan, it would be wiser not to bring up too much the U.S.-Philippine relationship,"" said Lully Miura, a scholar on international relations at the University of Tokyo.
""Instead, it would be better to focus more on the Japan-Philippine relationship, as the relationships between the three countries are very complicated right now,"" she said.

""I guess given the background of our relationship with China prior to the visit most of it was quite expected. It wasn't just an ice-breaking mission.

MANILA, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Commission on Elections (Comelec) en banc has upheld the disqualification of a female senator to run for president in the 2016 elections, a poll official said Wednesday.
Senator Grace Poe has been disqualified to run for president for failing to meet the constitutional requirements of a candidate, being a natural-born Filipino and a resident of the Philippines for at least 10 years on the day of the elections, said Comelec chairman Andres Bautista.
But Poe, whose qualification as a senator is also being questioned, can appeal the Comelec's decision before the Supreme Court.
The female senator is a foundling and was adopted only by famous actor and actress couple in the country. She was an American citizen before she decided to run and won in the Philippine Senate in 2010.
In the latest survey, Poe tied with Vice President Jejomar Binay as the top presidential contenders, edging former Local Government Secretary Manuel Roxas II, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, and Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago.

by Alito L. Malinao
MANILA, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- Seven months before the actual voting on May 9 next year, the election in the Philippines that would choose the successor to President Benigno Aquino III has officially started.
On Monday, Vice President Jejomar Binay and his running mate, Sen. Gregorio Honasan, led 21 other candidates for president to file their certificates of candidacy at the main office of the independent Commission on Elections (Comelec).
Among the ""early birds,"" Binay is the only one who seems to make it to the final list of serious contenders for the position of President Aquino whose six-year term ends in June next near.
Under the Philippine constitution, Aquino is barred from seeking another term.
Comelec Chairman Andes Bautista said that eventually the so- called ""nuisance candidates,"" those who have no means to conduct a nationwide campaign, would be removed from the official list of candidates.
Aquino has endorsed former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas to be his successor.
Roxas, along with Sen. Grace Poe, another top contender, is expected to file his certificate of candidacy before Friday, which is the end of the five-day registration period.
Ultimately, there will be a three-cornered fight for presidency in the Philippines in the upcoming polls with the three leading candidates -- Binay, Roxas, and Poe -- slugging it out after the rumored fourth presidential candidate, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, finally announced on Monday not to join the presidential derby.
The three candidates to succeed Aquino have a stark contrast in their personal lives and experiences.
Roxas, is a U.S.-educated economist, former senator, former congressman, and former cabinet minister. He is the son of a senator and grandson of the first president of the Philippine republic. His campaign strategy revolves around the ""straight path "" mantra of President Aquino, which calls for the eradication of graft in government.
Binay is a ""rags-to-riches"" story having been orphaned early in life but was able to become a lawyer and a long-time mayor of Makati City, the country's premier business district. He is facing a string of corruption cases in the Ombudsman. But since there is still no conviction, he is free to run for office.
Poe, who is leading in the poll surveys, is a foundling who was abandoned in a church but was later adopted by Fernando Poe, Jr., a famous actor who ran but lost in the 2004 presidential elections against former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
Also educated and a long-time resident in the U.S., Poe is charged in a tribunal of not being a natural-born Filipino citizen, a constitutional requirement for those running for any public office in the Philippines. Her citizenship case is still pending.
Roxas has picked up the relatively unknown Reni Robredo, a member of the legislature from the Bicol Region, south of Manila, as his vice presidential candidate while Poe has Sen. Chiz Escudero as her candidate for vice president.
Honasan, also from Bicol Region, Binay's running mate, is a former military officer who led several failed coup attempts against the government in the late 1980s.
Contenders for the vice presidential post include Sen. Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos, Jr., son of the late Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos. There were earlier reports that he would run for president but since he had a poor showing in the surveys, he decided to settle for the second highest position in the Philippines.
In his early campaign sorties in the province, Aquino asked Filipinos to vote for Roxas so that the country's economic growth and the fight against corruption would continue.
But the political opposition claimed that the country's growth is ephemeral and non-inclusive because the benefits did not filter down to the underprivileged sector.
Philippine elections, patterned after that of the U.S., are the most unwieldy in Asia, with scores killed or maimed during the final days of the campaign when politicians or their die-hard supporters often resort to violence.
In next year's elections, some 18,000 posts are at stake, including senators, congressmen and local officials.

 Military fails to capture Samal kidnappers in S. Philippines: media

"|"
MANILA, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- The kidnappers of three foreigners and a Filipino at a resort in Samal Island of southern Philippines last week have slipped through blockade of the Philippine military and police, local media reported on Tuesday.
Eastern Mindanao Command (Eastmincom) chief Lt. Gen. Aurelio Baladad said all leads being pursued by the combined military and police elements in Davao region have turned out to be false.
""The kidnappers, believed to be local contacts of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), intentionally used New People's Army as their cover to mislead pursuing government troops. They even left a note declaring that they are seeking justice for their commander,"" local media Philippine Star reported.
""This deception apparently paid off and gave the kidnappers time to escape with their hostages, traversing the coastal areas of Davao Gulf, mostly along Muslim communities, towards Sarangani province while thousands of military and police troops pursued them in the mountains of Davao del Norte and Davao del Surm,"" the report added.
Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte said on Sunday that he received reports that the kidnappers and their hostages Canadians John Ridsdel, 68, Robert Hall, 50, Norwegian resort manager Kjartan Sekkingstad and Hall's Filipino girlfriend Maritess Flor are now in Sulu.
However, according to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) spokesperson Col. Restituto Padilla, AFP and Philippine National Police are not convinced that ASG was behind the kidnap.
The 400-strong ASG, founded in the early 1990s by extremists, is notorious for a series of kidnappings, bombings and even beheadings in southern Philippines over the past decades.
The ASG operates mainly in Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi Provinces in the Sulu Archipelago and has a presence on Mindanao.

c_134632206.htm|2015-09-17| News Analysis: 4-cornered fight for the Philippine presidency in the offing|"
by Alito L. Malinao
MANILA, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Although the next presidential election in the Philippines is still eight months away, Filipinos from all walks of life are now deeply immersed in their favorite pastime with the election mania now heating up.
The current president, Benigno Aquino III, is barred from running for re-election after his six-year term ends in June next year, thus there is a vacancy in the highest administrative post in the country.
An election system practically copied from the United States, the country's former colonial master, elections in the Philippines are rowdy and oftentimes deadly with scores of partisan supporters killed during the campaign.
With the formal announcement of her long-anticipated run for the presidency Wednesday night, Sen. Grace Poe is currently the third candidate for president, after Vice President Jejomar Binay and former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas.
Rodrigo Duterte, the maverick mayor of Davao City in Mindanao in the southern Philippines, is expected to formally announce his candidacy for president next week. Duterte has recently said he is retiring from politics next year but millions of his rabid supporters are not taking ""No"" for an answer and he is reportedly going to backtrack from his previous announcement and make a run for the presidency.
If Mayor Duterte finally runs, it will be a four-cornered fight for Aquino's replacement in the elections scheduled in May next year.
Poe, the adopted daughter of the late Fernando Poe, Jr., a movie actor in the l970s who is popularly known by his initials FPJ, is running as an independent or without a distinct political party.
In her first political rally held at the campus of the University of the Philippines, Poe, who is a neophyte senator having been elected to her first-ever political position as senator only in 2013, has vowed to provide an alternative government to that of her opponents who are grizzled politicians.
There is a stark contrast in the life and background of the three candidates.
Poe is a foundling who was abandoned by her biological mother inside a church in the town of Jaro, in the province of Iloilo in central Philippines. She was later adopted by FPJ and his wife, Susan Roces, also a movie star.
Poe was educated and has lived in the U.S. with her family before moving back to the Philippines when her adoptive father ran and lost in the presidential elections in 2004.
Vice President Binay, who is running under the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) party, has a ""rags to riches"" story having been orphaned when he was a young boy but has struggled and worked his way through college and became a lawyer. He has been a long-time mayor of Makati City, the country's richest city and major business hub. Although a former ally of Aquino, Binay is running as an opposition candidate.
Roxas, on the other hand, is the candidate of the ruling Liberal Party (LP) and is the anointed candidate of Aquino. He has been a former senator, former congressman, and a former member of the Cabinet under three presidents, including the current one.
Roxas belongs to a wealthy and politically-influential family in the Philippines. He is the son of the late Gerry Roxas, a long- time senator, and grandson of Manuel Roxas, the first president of the Philippine Republic. Like many offspring of rich Filipino families, Roxas was educated in the U.S.
Although the official campaign has not started yet, the four candidates have already been barnstorming the country to tell the voters about their programs of government.
As the administration candidate, Roxas is banking on his party' s nationwide network and the support of Aquino who, despite some setbacks lately, has managed to score a high performance rating.
Roxas is using the ""straight path"" mantra of the administration, which means ""clean"" government, a not so subtle dig at the alleged rampant corruption during the past administrations.
Among the four candidates, Duterte has the most radical, if not scary, plans. He said if elected, he would abolish the legislature, establish a revolutionary government and work for a shift to a federal system to replace the existing republican form of government.

DAVAO CITY, Philippines, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- Leftist rebels freed on Sunday two soldiers captured in a raid at a Japanese- owned banana plantation in southern Philippines early this month, the military said on Monday.

 Political dynasties dominate Philippine politics

"|"

by Alito L. Malinao
MANILA, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- If Vice President Jejomar Binay will win in the 2016 presidential elections, he would be the best example of how a political dynasty can control national and local politics in the Philippines.
While Binay would be on the top of the Philippine officialdom as president, one of his daughters is a senator, another is a congresswoman, and a son, his namesake, is mayor of Makati, the country's premier city.
The issue of political dynasties is not new in the Philippines and is not limited to the political opposition led by Binay.
In fact, incumbent President Benigno Aquino III is a third generation member of a well-known political dynasty. He is the son of the late President Corazon Aquino and the martyred Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr. His grandfather, the late Benigno Aquino, Sr., was one-time speaker of the House of Representatives.
Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas, the presumptive opponent of Binay in the 2016 presidential race, is also a third generation politician from a political clan. His late father, Gerry Roxas, was a senator and his grandfather was the first president of the Philippine Republic.
The list of the current crop of politicians who are members of political dynasties can go on and on.
In the Philippine Senate alone, three are sons of former presidents. The siblings Jinggoy Estrada and J.V. Ejercito are both sons of former President Joseph Estrada, who was ousted by a military-backed civilian uprising after only two years in office.
Senator Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos is the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. He is rumored to have ambitions to run in the 2016 presidential derby. His mother, the former First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos, now 84, is a congresswoman representing the province of Ilocos Norte in northern Luzon while a sister is the governor of the province.
Is there no end to the dominance of family dynasties in Philippine politics?
A number of bills have been filed in both houses of Congress precisely to put an end to political dynasties as provided for in the Philippine Constitution.
Section 26, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states ""The state shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law. ""
But since l987, the Philippine Congress has failed to enact an enabling law that would implement the constitutional prohibition of political dynasties.
In Senate Bill 2649, also known as the Anti-Political Dynasty Act, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago defines a dynasty as a situation when an incumbent official's spouse or his or her second- degree relatives hold or seek office together, or when a spouse or relative succeeds him or her.
Santiago said that her bill would level the playing field of the political arena and would open it to persons who are equally qualified to aspire for government elective posts but who cannot hope to win against well-entrenched politically-dominant families.
""In many instances, voters, for convenience and out of cultural mindset, look up to these ruling families as dispensers of favors and thus elect them or their relatives to public office,""Santiago said.
Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio has defined political dynasties as a ""phenomenon that concentrates political power and public resources within the control of a few families whose members alternately hold elective offices, deftly skirting term limits.""
One good example of how politically-entrenched families can circumvent the law is Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Davao City in the southern Philippines. The feisty mayor is known for his extra- legal methods in going after the city's hoodlums.
Under the law, a local official can only hold office for three consecutive terms of three years each. When Duterte's nine-year term as city mayor ended, he pushed his daughter to run for mayor and he as vice mayor and both of them won. After his daughter's term as mayor lapsed, Duterte again run for mayor and has since regained his post.
Duterte's case is being replicated in other cities and provinces in the country where members of political dynasties take turn in holding elective posts to the exclusion of other individuals who cannot win an election because of lack of resources.
A recent study by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism traced the emergence of political dynasties in the Philippines to the introduction by the Americans of electoral politics in the early 20th century, when voting was initially limited to the rich and the landed, who then monopolized public office.
The study said that the motive behind political dynasties is primarily to protect the families' interests in the legislature and executive branches of the government to the detriment of the majority.
""Political dynasties are a terrible indictment of the kind of politics we have,"" said former Senator Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. ""I do not believe that any one family has the monopoly of talent to run the government.""
But Pimentel was being dishonest in his observation. His son and namesake, Aquilino Pimentel III, is now a senator of the Republic.

 Philippine gov't maintains no Filipinos recruited by ISIS

MANILA, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine military has denied reports that some Filipinos had been recruited and trained by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said on Monday.

Lacierda said AFP intelligence group had denied any information that Filipinos are training and fighting with the ISIS.

MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Benigno Aquino III confirmed Tuesday a ""raw"" information regarding a possible bomb attack in southern Philippine city of Davao.
Aquino told reporters that he passed on to Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte the raw information to adequately prepare the city. The attack is said to be perpetrated by a terrorist with international links.
""The reports stated and I emphasize, the raw report stated that this terrorist who is a bomb maker had sent a bomb or a bomb-laden vehicle to Davao City to further a terrorist attack,"" he said.
Despite the raw information, he said the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines are actively determining the validity of the report and continuing operations against the known terrorist.
The President indicated that the raw information was connected to the recent arrest in Paranaque City, Metro Manila of a high- ranking official of terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group, Khair Mundos, who was also on the terror watch list of the United States.
""So at the present time, he is already under custody and we are still following up all of the available leads to ensure the safety of everybody in the Philippines,"" he said.

MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Security forces of the Philippines have been ordered to verify information regarding the alleged security threat in the southern part of the country, a senior Philippine government official said on Sunday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. said in an interview at the state-run radio station that the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) are now on alert and coordinating with each other to check possible terrorist threat.
It was Philippine President Benigno Aquino III who called up Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of the southern city of Davao to inform him about the possible terrorist attack in the city or other parts of Mindanao, such as the cities of Cagayan de Oro, Koronadal, and Kidapawan.
Quoting Ramon Zagala, chief public information officer of the AFP, Coloma said that the military and police units in Eastern Mindanao, including Davao, have always been on the alert even before the report of the president was announced.
The reported threat came as the Muslim Filipinos start their holy month of Ramadan on Sunday and the arrest recently of a high- ranking official of the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group, Khair Mundos, who was also on the terror watch list of the United States.

DAVAO CITY, Philippines, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Leftist rebels released on Monday five government surveyors who were abducted in southern Philippines on Friday, authorities said.
The five sub-contractors of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) were released late Monday to Rodrigo Duterte, mayor of regional center Davao who has received freed rebel prisoners in the past, said Voltaire Rimando, chairman of the Crisis Management Committee.
Rimando and the military initially reported that there were six victims seized by the rebels. In admitting responsibility over the abduction earlier on Monday, the NPA said they took only five victims.
The five were seized while conducting survey and mapping operations in the hinterlands of New Leyte village, Maco town, in Mindanao's Compostela Valley province on May 30.
""The NPA maintains that the anti-logging aerial reconnaissance is merely a pretext to intensify imperialist mining plunder and counter-revolutionary intelligence in Southern Mindanao,"" said Daniel Ibarra, spokesman of the NPA ComVal-Davao Gulf sub-region.
Ibarra said one sky surfer drone and two multi-rotor drones, two laptops and one GPS were confiscated from Sky Eye personnel.

 Leftist rebels free kidnapped soldier in S. Philippines

DAVAO CITY, Philippines, Aug. 25 (Xinhua)--- Leftist rebels released Saturday a soldier they have kidnapped early this month in Southern Philippines in an incident that insurgents claimed was preceded by a bomb attack that killed several soldiers.
Rodrigo Duterte, mayor of the regional center Davao City, helped in facilitating the release by the New People's Army of Private First Class Rodelio Rigonan in the hinterlands of Mindanao' s Compostela Valley province, said Captain Severino David, spokesperson of the military's Eastern Mindanao Command ( Eastmincom). ""He is now being de-briefed at the Eastmincom headquarters (in Davao),""David said, even as he denied claims by the NPA that the military had prevented the freed soldier to meet with his wife.
Rubi del Mundo, NPA spokesperson in southern Mindanao region, said Rigonan's release was on""humanitarian grounds.""
The military said the soldier, an electrician assigned at an army base in Maco town, also in Compostela Valley, was abducted by armed NPAs at his village in Langgam last Aug. 3 while helping a neighbor install a downed electrical connection. ""He was unarmed and off-duty but the bandits still took him,"" said David, adding that the victim had also tried to stop NPA guerrillas who were attempting to plant an improvised bomb in the village when he was taken at gunpoint.

 News Analysis: Proposal to increase U.S. military presence in the Philippines assailed, defended

"|"

By Alito L. Malinao
MANILA, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- The proposed agreement between Manila and Washington to increase U.S. military presence in the country by allowing American troops to use Philippine bases has been assailed and defended.
The militant Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (New Nationalist Alliance) said that the proposal could be ""worse"" than the military bases agreement that was terminated by the Philippines in l991.
Renato Reyes, secretary-general of the alliance, said that the new agreement if signed ""will allow U.S. troops to be present all over the country. Every Philippine military facility, not just Subic and Clark, can now be accessed by U.S. troops.""
Subic Naval Base in Subic, Zambales and Clark Air Base in Pampanga, both north of Manila, used to be the two largest U.S. military facilities in the region before the abrogation of the military accord with the U.S. two decades ago.
But Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario said increased ""rotational presence"" of the U.S. troops in the Philippines will ensure ""the security of our people and the territorial integrity of our nation.""
Del Rosario said that aside from security considerations, the expanded U.S. military presence will ""vastly improve"" the country' s ability to provide Filipinos and the region with timely and responsive humanitarian and disaster relief.
Del Rosario also gave the assurance that the agreement will not violate the Philippine Constitution, which among other things, bans the presence of nuclear arms in the country. A number of U.S. warships are known to carry nuclear missiles.
""Our Philippine negotiators have been given parameters that require them to ensure that our Constitution and laws are fully respected. They have been tasked to ensure that Philippine interests are preserved and promoted,"" he said.
The Department of Foreign Affairs is participating in the negotiations between the defense officials of the two countries. The first round was held in Manila on Monday; the second round will be held in Washington, D.C.
Del Rosario said that while the Philippines is steadfastly for peace in the region, it also stands ready ""to tap every resource, to call on every alliance, to do what is necessary in order to defend what is ours, to secure our nation and to keep our people safe.""
But Reyes said that more than the frequent port calls for refuelling, resupply and recreation, U.S. forces will now be allowed to preposition their weapons and equipment in Philippine military facilities.
""This means turning the entire country into a huge U.S. military base,"" Reyes said.
Reyes said that the Philippine government will have no control over these equipment and vehicles, citing the current Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which does not give the Philippines the right to inspect U.S. war materiel.
The negotiation between the Philippines and the United States over the framework agreement on the American forces' increased rotational presence in the Philippines was nothing but a "" masquerade"", the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) said Wednesday.
The leftist rebel group said that the talks which began on Wednesday were just to formalize what has been the U.S. practice of making use of the Philippines as a military base.
""The plan to grant the U.S. greater military access to local ports and infrastructure and to extend rights to set up its own facilities has long been agreed upon by the Aquino government and the U.S. military,"" said the CPP, the umbrella group of the New People's Army.
This arrangement was clinched in the Strategic Defense Dialogue held in Washington in January 2012 right after U.S. President Barack Obama declared his government's strategy to pivot toward Asia where it plans to deploy more than half of its naval forces, it said.
The CPP reiterated its position that further strengthening and expanding U.S. military presence in the Philippines violate Philippine sovereignty.
Senate President Franklin Drilon also urged Philippine negotiators to ensure that the proposed accord would be legal and constitutional.
""As a senator, it is my obligation to our people to ensure that any agreement the government will enter into is legal and in accordance with our Constitution. I will examine the outcome of the negotiations to see to it that it will not infringe on the lives of our people and their guaranteed rights,"" Drilon said.
Drilon said any agreement on increased American presence must be governed by the terms of the VFA and must preclude the possibility of granting permanent basing rights to foreign forces.
""The framework agreement should be in accordance with the restrictions set forth under the VFA,"" he said.
The VFA that allows limited American military presence in the country was signed in 1991 in lieu of a formal bases agreement.
Meanwhile, Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Davao City in southern Philippines revealed that he has rejected a U.S government request to use the city's old airport as an operating base for its drone program.
""The U.S. government wants to use the old airport. I refused. I will not allow them to use our airport for them to launch their drones,"" Duterte was quoted as saying Monday by the local media.
Duterte, known for being straightforward, said that he does not want his city to be used as a base for unmanned aerial vehicles by the U.S. in its campaign against terrorism and insurgency.
""I do not want it. I do not want trouble and killings,"" Duterte said.
He said he told the U.S. government that there would be more bloodshed if there were drone operators in the city. ""They will only add to the problem,"" Duterte said.
Duterte said that in 2011, he believed the U.S. was engaged in covert operations against Muslim extremists in Davao City.

Death toll in S Philippine flashflood rises to 25


"|"


MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of people that died from drowning due to a flashflood that swamped some parts of southern Philippines has risen to 25, while 15 remain missing, a military official said Wednesday.
According to Maj. Jacob Thaddeus Obligado, commander of the Army's 10th Civil Military Operations Battalion, many of the fatalities are children. He said three of the fatalities are unidentified.
Obligado, whose unit is among those who responded to the calamity, said the flooding has affected about 25,000 families. Of the number, 1,475 families are staying in four evacuation centers.
Obligado said the downpour started around 10 p.m. local time and lasted for about three hours.
In a separate interview, Gretchin Cinco, deputy police spokesperson for Davao region, said the Davao city government had provided food, clothing and bedding materials to some 20,000 families in various evacuation centers in the city.
Cinco said the waters have already subsided in most of Talomo district which was badly hit by rampaging waters following several hours of heavy downpour late Tuesday.
""The waters rose to as high as ten feet, submerging homes in just minutes, leaving us residents trapped in rooftops,"" resident Jun Adlawan told Xinhua by phone, adding they were isolated for hours before rescuers arrived early Wednesday.
The destructive force of the floodwaters was so powerful that it swept cars, overturned parked trucks and pulled off trees, witnesses said.
The torrential rains caused Pangi and Balusong rivers to burst their banks, inundating the affected areas.
Cinco said floodwaters started to recede on Wednesday but roads from Talomo going up to the city's southern parts were still impassable to most types of vehicles.
Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte has placed the villages of Matina Pangi, Matina Crossing, Matina Aplaya and Talomo comprising Talomo district under state of calamity.

Corporal Daiem Hadjaie was released by his New People's Army ( NPA) captors to local officials led by Davao city vice mayor Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday in the hinterlands of the gold-rich Compostela Valley, according to Lieutenant Colonel Gilbert Saret, the soldier's battalion commander.
""Yes, he (Hadjaie) is already released and is undergoing medical examination at the Panacan regional military hospital in Davao City,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Medel Aguilar, an army regional spokesperson.
Hadjaie's release came a day after the local NPA leadership gave assurance to his family about his health and called on the military to abort combat operations in attempts to rescue him.
The victim, a former Moro National Liberation Front rebel who was integrated into the Philippine army as part of a peace deal between the government and the former Moro rebel group, was snatched at an NPA checkpoint at a village in Monkayo town on his way to a medical checkup at the regional military hospital during the Eid al-Adha celebration 12 days ago.
The NPA, armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, has been waging a guerrilla campaign in the countryside for four decades. Military estimates the NPA strength at more than 4,000 fighters scattered in more than 60 guerrilla fronts throughout the country.
Peace talks between the government and the leftists bogged down after the United States included the NPA and its parent body as foreign terrorist organizations in 2002.

Â Â Â Â Mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Davao City, the third largest city in the

TOKYO, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Wednesday that he wanted foreign military troops out of his country ""probably in the next two years.""
Duterte, who is on a three-day visit to Japan, made the remarks before his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later in the day.
Mentioning the U.S. colonial control of the Philippines over half a century, Duterte said he would pursue an independent foreign policy and the Philippines will ""survive"" without U.S. assistance.
Former Philippine president Benigno Aquino III signed an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the U.S. in 2014, which allowed the return of U.S. troops to the Philippines after the country expelled U.S. soldiers in the 1990s.
Duterte, who took office in June, has reportedly talked about abrogating defense agreements with the U.S several times over the past two months.
Earlier, he also called for the expulsion of about 100 U.S. Special Forces posted in Zamboanga City on Mindanao, who were tasked to help the Philippine military fight against terrorism.

MANILA, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Filipino ""comfort women"" urged President Rodrigo Duterte to raise their plight in his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
""At least mention the comfort women,"" said Rechilda Extremadura, executive director of Lila Pilipina, an organization of World War II comfort women.
She lamented that the previous Philippine administrations have ignored the plight of the Filipino women who were forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War II in talks with Japanese government.
""Our previous leaders have failed us because they are all afraid of rumpling feathers of diplomacy with Japan. With President Duterte, who we believe is no pushover, we are hopeful that finally the issue will be placed in the agenda, at the very least,"" she said in a statement.
Extremadura said Duterte, who is pursuing an independent foreign policy, can stand up to Japan and seek recognition for the wartime sexual slavery that the comfort women endured during the last world war.
""We seek historical recognition for comfort women as much as we seek compensation for the (grandmothers) to make their twilight years more comfortable. We are afraid that as we speak, (grandmothers) are growing weaker and weaker and they may no longer live to see the day that justice will finally be given to them,"" she said.
""The comfort women support Duterte's independent foreign policy because they do not want the next generation to experience wartime sexual abuse,"" Extremadura said.
Lila Pilipina has been campaigning against the Visiting Forces Agreement and the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement with the United States ""because the agreements will breed sexual violence and abuse of women"".
""We support Duterte's statement that he will not allow foreign military troops, including Japanese troops, in the country. We reiterate our call: Never again to another generation of comfort women,"" Extremadura said.
Lila Pilipina (League of Filipino Women) has documented 174 ""comfort women"" who have gone public since early 1990s. Only 70 of them remain alive. Another group, the Malaya Lolas (Free Grandmothers), has documented 90 but the number dwindled to 33 following the death of the rest over the years.
Both groups are demanding: official apology, just compensation, and inclusion of the comfort women issue in Japan's historical accounts and textbooks.
The Philippine government has intentionally avoided discussions of the issue in bilateral talks with Japan.

MANILA, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte voiced aversion on Tuesday to the presence of foreign troops in the Philippines, saying the country's constitution dictates that the Philippines pursue an independent foreign policy.
At the news conference before departing for Tokyo where he is making a three-day visit, Duterte said his country does not have to ""dovetail what the policies of other countries are especially in the matter of stationing of military troops"" in the Philippines.
The Philippines has a defense treaty with the United States and defense agreements that allow U.S. troops to conduct joint exercises with Philippine troops. In 2014, Manila inked a defense agreement with Washington granting U.S. troops access to Philippine military bases.
Duterte has earlier said that he wanted to cut the joint military exercises with the U.S. troops and wanted the U.S. military experts out of Mindanao.
""I want an independent policy that I will not kowtow to anybody,"" he said.

BEIJING, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, an official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, has criticized a U.S. warship's intrusion into Chinese territorial waters in the South China Sea, saying such action will only speed up the decline of U.S. influence.
The newspaper on Sunday published an article to denounce USS Decatur's intrusion into Chinese territorial waters near Xisha Islands on Friday.
The Chinese Defense Ministry branded the intrusion as an ""illegal and provocative"" move. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also urged the United States to stop ""irresponsible"" and ""provocative"" actions which go against China's sovereignty and maritime interests.
The U.S. destroyer's move is a serious violation of China's sovereignty and international law. It also disrupted peace, safety and order on the sea, the article said.
The intrusion happened as Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was in China for a visit to China, during which a series of cooperative agreements were signed.
At a time when countries on the South China Sea issue are improving relations, and a proper solution of the issue has shown encouraging momentum, the messing up by a U.S. destroyer has revealed clearly that Washington cannot accept a peaceful and stable South China Sea, the article said.
""The U.S. feels a little anxious over China's sound ties with the Philippines,"" Duterte said in Beijing.
U.S. hegemony with provocative actions will only result in the accelerated decline of its global influence, the article read.
Washington will gain influence in the Asia-Pacific only by taking active part in promoting common development in the region, it said. ""The outdated hegemonic mentality is not compatible with the regional countries' pursue of peace, cooperation and development.""
In recent years, the United States has been messing up in the South China Sea under the excuse of ""freedom of navigation."" It has also been seeking to sow discord between China and the Philippines.
""Flexing military muscles does not make a country super power, let alone creating discord and muddying waters in the South China Sea,"" the article said.
The Philippines' choice to adjust its diplomatic policies and reinforce cooperation with China also proves that an unjust cause committed by the U.S. finds little support, it said.
Also, China is determined to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. ""China will ... fight for every inch of its territory within its sovereignty,"" the article stressed.
It warned that U.S. hegemony will only prompt China to strengthen defense and its resolution to improve capacity to safeguard its own interests.
The Chinese military will safeguard national sovereignty and security by beefing up patrols and optimizing its defensive capabilities. ""China will never allow the United States to run amok in the South China Sea, which is a major issue of principle,"" the article concluded.

""It implies breaking away from the debilitating mindset of dependency and subservience - economically and militarily - that have perpetuated our 'little brown brother' image to America, which has stunted our growth and advancement,"" Perfecto Yasay wrote on his Facebook page.
He parroted the explanation made earlier by President Rodrigo Duterte that Philippines' separation from the U.S. economically and military does not mean severance of relationship or terminating the special bond between the two nations.
Indeed, he said that breaking away from ""our closest friend, only military ally and strategic partner would not be in our best national interest"" as declared unmistakably by Duterte on his arrival in Davao City from his successful trip to China early Saturday.
""Dismantling this old paradigm to give way to new stronger structures and methods in promoting better understanding and mutually beneficial relationships does not signify destroying alliances, making enemies or creating new barriers towards working together,"" Yasay explained.
The top Philippine diplomat added, ""It simply means letting go of the disguised chains that continue to hold us captive to foreign interests in order to enable our people and duly elected leaders to address our urgent problems and needs in the light of our priorities, experiences and values without undue outside interference.""
The separation means enabling the Philippines as a sovereign equal with all nations ""in securing world peace not war, forging stronger friendships and not enmity and making our planet a better and safer place for everyone,"" Yasay said.

MANILA, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Tuesday that he would ""eventually"" cut ties with the United States.
Duterte again hit out at the United States and its president, the European Union and the United Nations for using human rights to criticize his campaign to curb the illicit drug menace in the Philippines.
""I am very emotional because America has certainly failed us,"" Duterte added.
""I will be re-configuring my foreign policy,"" Duterte said in a speech before the Jewish Association of the Philippines in Makati City.
He added, ""Eventually I might in my time break up with America. I would rather go to Russia and to China. ""
In another speech earlier, Duterte vowed to continue the war on drugs amidst the ""hypocrisy"" of the U.S., the EU and the UN.
""I will not stop despite the hypocrisy of the EU, and America and Obama. They seem to refuse to understand,"" Duterte said.
Duterte said he has no plan to stop his rant again his critics.
Duterte again apologized to the Jewish community. ""I am not one of the racist member of this republic,"" he said.
""But it was only because that they pictured me to be killing so many persons of the drug problem. And I would say that it is true but not all were killed with their hands tied behind their backs. That would have been an exaggeration,"" he explained.
Last Sunday, Duterte apologized to the Jewish community who were outraged by his comments that made reference to Adolf Hitler who ordered the cold-blooded killings of the Jews.
""I would like to make it (clear) now, here and now, that there was never an intention on my part to derogate the memory of the six million Jews murdered,"" Duterte said in a speech in Bacolod City in the central Philippines.

MANILA, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Sunday that his administration needs another six months to win the war against drug-related crimes in the country.
""I never realized the (illegal drug) problem is this big,"" Duterte said when he presented a freed Norwegian hostage who had been released a day ago from captivity by the Abu Sayyaf bandits.
""Just give me a little extension of maybe another six months,"" the Philippine president said.
Duterte, who assumed presidency on June 30, has vowed to solve the problem of rampant criminality and illegal drug trade in the country in six months.
But he admitted for the first time on Sunday that in spite of his administration's relentless and sustained war against drug-related crimes, the six-month deadline he imposed on himself is not enough.
The initial self-imposed deadline to curb illegal drugs will end in December.
According to Philippine police, nearly 3,000 people have been killed in police anti-drug operations and extrajudicial killings in the past more than two months.
Philippine police have so far carried out 18,500 operations to arrest suspected drug users and pushers, which have resulted in the arrest of 17,528 suspects.
More than 700,000 users and pushers have already ""surrendered,"" including local officials, rogue policemen, military generals whom Duterte included in his long list of drug users, pushers and protectors.

At least 10 people have been confirmed dead and scores others wounded in an explosion in the hometown of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday night, officials said on Saturday, amid fears the toll could further rise. (Xinhua/STRINGE)
MANILA, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared Saturday ""state of lawlessness"" in southern island of Mindanao following a deadly attack allegedly perpetrated by the Abu Sayyaf Group in Davao City.
In an interview with reporters, Duterte said his declaration of state of lawlessness ""would require nationwide, well-coordinated efforts of the military and the police.""
He clarified that it is not a declaration of martial law.
""I have this duty to protect the country. I have this duty to keep intact the integrity of the nation,"" the president said.
Death toll from the explosion reached 14, while over 70 were injured.
In a separate statement, Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the president's declaration of a state of lawlessness is rooted in Article VII Section 18 of the Constitution.
The declaration is limited such that he can only call out the armed forces to suppress the lawless violence, Abella said, adding that there was no suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
""It is a different case from the existence of invasion or rebellion. Only if there is invasion or rebellion, and when public safety requires it, can he suspend the writ of habeas corpus or declare martial law,"" he explained.
According to Interior and Local Government Secretary Mike Sueno, the Abu Sayyaf Group has claimed responsibility for the attack at the Davao night market late Friday night.
Duterte came from Davao City and his daughter and son are the mayor and vice-mayor, respectively, of the city.
Prior to the attack, the military has been conducting intensified operation against the bandits in southern province of Sulu after they beheaded a Filipino hostage.
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he has directed all commands of the Armed Forces of the Philippines ""to be on high alert especially in urban centers for possible other terroristic act attempts by this group.""
The Eastern Command in Davao city has been directed to assist the Philippine National Police in maintaining peace and order in Davao City and in the apprehension of the perpetrators, he said.
""They will also aid in gathering intelligence information and in conducting investigations to get to the bottom of this unfortunate incident,"" he added.

Yasay called a briefing to clarify the statement made by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday that the Philippines will ""separate"" from the UN after the body criticized his war on illicit drugs.
""We certainly are not leaving the UN,"" Yasay told a news conference at the Department of Foreign Affairs.
Duterte was angered by statements made by a UN official condemning the increasing number of vigilante-type killings in the country. There are more than 1,000 people killed in the campaign, according to media reports.
""Maybe we just have to separate from the United Nations. If you are that rude, we might just leave the organization,"" Duterte told a news conference in Davao City on Sunday, referring to the UN critics.
Duterte even said that he might as well form a rival organization with China and other African (nations). Duterte criticized the UN for its failure to stamp out terrorism, world hunger and other conflicts.
Duterte's spokesperson, Ernesto Abella, also told a separate news conference at the Malacalanang presidential palace that the Philippines is not ""decoupling"" from the UN.
""He is simply reiterating national sovereignty and the fact that he did not welcome interventions or what you would consider meddling. He was stating the fact that the Philippines is a sovereign nation and should not be meddled with,"" Abella said.
Abella said that the war on drugs ""are within the our ambit of national sovereignty, national concerns, and that at this stage there was no call for the UN to make any investigations.""
""If there would be serious intentions about investigating these matters they should have made formal presentations and not just made general statements. The UN as a public institutions should have made formal representations because we also are a formal institution,"" Abella said.

MANILA, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday implicated a female senator in illegal drugs, accusing the unnamed senator of using drug money to finance her campaign during the May elections.
In a speech before policemen at the main headquarters of the Philippine National Police in Quezon City, Duterte also accused the woman senator, whom he did not name, of adultery.
""Here's a senator complaining. One day I will tell you that her driver himself, who was her lover, was the one collecting money for her during the campaign,"" Duterte said.
He called the lawmaker an ""immoral woman"" who flaunts her alleged illicit relationship with a married driver. ""As far as the wife of the driver was concerned, it's adultery,"" he said.
""Here is a woman who funded the house of her lover and yet we do not say any complaint about her. Those money came readily from her,"" he added.
But Duterte later clarified that he was unsure whether the driver gave the money he collected to the woman senator. ""But in fairness, I would never say here that the driver gave the money to her. But by the looks of it she has it.""
He said the senator has no moral authority to criticize the spate of killings happening in the country, victimizing people who are suspected to be involved in illegal drugs.
He blasted the senator for ""political posturing,"" adding ""you yourself has a very sordid personal and official life.""
Last week, Duterte vowed to ""destroy in public"" a woman government official whom he described as a ""human rights stalwart"".
Very much bothered by the drug menace affecting the country, the president said there are about 3.7 million Filipinos who are dependent in drugs roaming around the country, preying on children and youths.
""Now, we are seeing our country devastated by drugs. It has not only affected millions but a lot of them no longer viable as human beings in the planet,"" he said.
Duterte has intensified his election campaign to ""kill"" illegal drug protectors, users and pushers. So far, he has implicated almost 200 people in the so-called ""name-and-shame"" campaign, including judges, policemen and local officials.
One of the lawmakers who met with Duterte in the Malacanang presidential palace on Monday told reporters that Duterte is set to release a new list of politicians allegedly involved in the illegal drug trade. It was not clear if the name of the female senator is included in the forthcoming list.
Philippine media have tallied nearly 700 vigilante-type killings related to illicit drugs since Duterte assumed the presidency in June.
Local reporters sought the reaction of Senator Leila de Lima, a known critic of Duterte, if she felt alluded to by Duterte's statement. She said she was surprised by Duterte's statement ""but I won't be cowed.""
""I don't want to dignify that. To me t's very foul. It's character assassination. That is a very clear case of character assassination and I do not expect the president to do that,"" she said.
""I hope (Duterte verifies) his facts and sources. He needs to double check the facts. I also hope that he announces the sources of this information.""

MANILA, Aug. 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte defended on Wednesday his criticism of the U.S. envoy to the Philippines for meddling with Philippine domestic affairs, downplaying his statements against U.S. ambassador he made last week.
Duterte said in a speech at a military camp in Zamboanga del Sur in the southern Philippines that Philip Goldberg, the U.S. envoy, has indeed criticized his statement regarding the rape and murder of an Australian missionary during the election campaign.
""They're simply true, anyway,"" Duterte said, adding that Goldberg's remarks was highly inappropriate and that the envoy should not have done it.
""He is not supposed to meddle (with our affairs) because that's our business,"" Duterte said.
Goldberg, at the height of the campaign in April, criticized Duterte for making joke about the rape and murder of an Australian missionary during a jail riot in Davao in 1989. Duterte took offence of Goldberg's statement.
Elizabeth Trudeau, spokeswoman of U.S. State Department, told a news conference on Monday that the department summoned Patrick Chuasoto, the diplomat in charge of the Philippine Embassy in Washington D.C,. to clarify Duterte's remarks about Goldberg.
""We've seen those inappropriate comments made about Ambassador Goldberg,"" Trudeau said, adding that Goldberg was a ""multi-time ambassador and one of our most senior U.S. diplomats."" She declined to give details of the meeting.
Charles Jose, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, also confirmed that Chuasoto was indeed ""invited"" by the State Department ""to discuss the entire breadth of Philippine-U.S. relations.""

Duterte reportedly called Goldberg a ""gay ambassador"" and ""son of a bitch"" during a recent meeting with soldiers.

In a news conference in Davao City in the early hours on Sunday morning, Duterte said there are an estimated 600,000 Filipinos who are drug addicts, pushers and users nationwide.
""I grieve for my country,"" Duterte said, lamenting that the drug problem has worsened ""because government personnel were into it.""
Duterte read the long list of names during the news conference that lasted two hours, ordering those he named to report to their mother units within 24 hours. Some of those he named were retired police officers and former local officials from all over the country.
""You are hereby relieved of your duty and immediately report to your mother units,"" he said. ""I'd like to give you the advice: once you hear your name mentioned here you are now relieved of your present assignments.""
He also ordered the cancellation of ""any and all"" firearm permits and licenses issues to them cancelled immediately.
He said judges should report to the Supreme Court, the local government officials to the Department of Interior and Local Government, and the military and the police to their superiors in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)and the Philippine National Police (PNP)within 24 hours.
""If you do not do that I will order the AFP and the entire PNP to hunt for you,"" Duterte said.
Duterte also ordered to remove the ""operational authority"" over the military and police officials assigned to mayors and other local government officials he named.
Duterte also named Iloilo, a province in the central Philippines as the most ""shabulized"" province in the country, referring to the magnitude and extent of methamphetamine use in the region.
He said those names that made it to the list that he read had been validated. ""I am the sole person responsible,"" he said.
On July 5, Duterte also named at least five police generals who are allegedly ""protectors of illegal drug syndicates"" operating in the country. The police officers are now being investigated.
Since the names of the five generals were bared at least four local officials or former local officials have submitted themselves to the police for further verification. Some have admitted using illegal drugs but denied allegations they are protectors.
Duterte has intensified his war against criminals, especially drug lords. He has also repeatedly warned these drug lords who are preying on the youths of the land, warning that ""it's going to be a dirty and bloody fight.""
Since he assumed the presidency on June 30, Duterte has ordered the police to crack the whip on drug lords and their protectors that allegedly include police officers and even the so-called ""narco politicians.""
So far, the media has recorded at least 600 people who were killed in the campaign against illegal drugs. The death toll continues to rise, causing human rights groups to demand an investigation into the unabated extra-judicial killings.

MANILA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) on Sunday said it is open to declaring a unilateral truce with the administration of President Duterte who lifted a government ceasefire with the communists on Saturday.
In a statement, the CPP Central Committee said it was willing to declare the ceasefire in support of the peace negations with the government which is due to resume in Oslo, Norte for Aug. 20 to 27.
The CPP said it supports the resumption of the peace talks with the government ""as a means of discussing the roots of the armed conflict."" Also, it expects the Duterte government to make good its promise to release all their peace consultants and all political prisoners.
""To further support peace negotiations, the CPP is willing to issue a unilateral ceasefire declaration separately but simultaneously with the Duterte government on Aug. 20. The time-frame can be determined through negotiations,""it said.
It said the two sides""can thereafter exchange these declarations in order to discuss points for cooperation and coordination and determine ways of preventing armed skirmishes, misunderstandings and miscommunications during the course of the peace talks.""
It said it welcomed the government ceasefire when it was declared by Duterte on July 25.""It is too bad that he has withdrawn such an order,""said the CPP, referring to Duterte's lifting of the truce for the failure of the communists to reciprocate it last Saturday.
""We trust, however, that this (lifting) will not affect preparations for formal resumption of peace negotiations scheduled for Aug. 20-27 in Oslo, Norway, nor will it preclude the GRP president from reissuing such a declaration simultaneously with a similar unilateral declaration by the CPP and NPA (New People's Army) on Aug. 20,""the CPP said.
The CPP said the Central Committee had been drafting its interim ceasefire declaration since July 25 to promote the peace negotiations. The statement said it was supposed to announce its reciprocal ceasefire declaration around 8 p.m. but Duterte announced the lifting of the government truce about an hour earlier.
Duterte demanded the communists to reciprocate the government truce on Saturday afternoon. Days earlier, he lashed at the communist movement for ambushing militiamen, who were returning to their base in compliance with the government truce last Wednesday in Davao del Norte. One of the militiamen died and four others were injured.
""It was quite capricious for the GRP(Government of the Republic of the Philippines) president to have imposed such ultimatums of a few hours or several days for the CPP to act in accordance with his whims. It was quite disconcerting that the GRP president would impose such an inflexible ultimatum on the CPP. Despite his anti-crime bravado, it would seem he has shown the drug lords and protectors of criminal syndicates more flexibility and accommodation,""the CPP said.
""It is advisable for the GRP president to exercise a little more prudence and display more measured temperament as a way of appreciating the situation from a broader historical perspective in order to avoid such impulsive acts as imposing ultimatums by the hour on a conflict that has spanned nearly fifty years,""it also said.
The CPP added that there was actually""zero compliance""to the ceasefire on the part of the AFP.
""Its (AFP) public expression of support for the ceasefire declaration was not reflected on the ground. Not a single AFP command ordered its troops withdrawn back to their barracks,""the CPP said.
Citing a report from the NPA unit involved in the Davao del Norte ambush, the CPP said NPA fighters were"" provoked to carry out the ambush as part of its active defense in the face of an imminent armed encounter with the operating armed troops and auxiliary forces of the 72nd IB (infantry battalion) of the AFP.""
The NPA, the armed front of the Communist Party of the Philippines-National Democratic Front, has been waging war against the government for over four decades.
The communist rebellion has killed 30,000 people since 1960s, and the NPA is believed to have fewer than 4,000 men today, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s, according to the military.

MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte lifted Saturday night his unilateral declaration of ceasefire with the leftist rebels and ordered the security forces to be ""on high alert.""
In a statement released at 7:00 p.m. local time, Duterte said: ""Let me now announce that I am hereby ordering the immediate lifting of the unilateral ceasefire that I ordered on July 25 against the communist rebels.""
On July 25, Duterte declared the unilateral ceasefire with the communist rebels, voicing the hope that the rebels will reciprocate to his peace offer.
""To immediately stop violence on the ground, restore peace in the communities and provide an enabling environment conducive to the resumption of peace negotiations, I am announcing a unilateral ceasefire with the Communist Party of the Philippines, the New People's Army and the National Democratic Front effective immediately,"" Duterte said during his first State of the Nation Address.
The President withdrew the truce declaration after the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) failed to meet his ultimatum for the rebels to reciprocate the truce until 5:00 p.m. local time Saturday.
He issued the ultimatum after the rebels ambushed a group of paramilitary in southern province of Davao del Norte two days after he declared the unilateral suspension of offensive military operations during his first State of the Nation Address.
A militiaman was killed and four others were wounded in the attack.
With the lifting of the unilateral truce, Duterte ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to also withdraw the operational guidelines they issued in pursuance to the ceasefire declaration.
""I am ordering all security forces to be on high alert and continue to discharge their normal functions and mandate to neutralize all threats to national security, protect the citizenry , enforce the laws and maintain peace in the land,"" he said.
The Philippine military said the NPA has an estimated 4,000 members. The rebels have been fighting the government since 1969 in one of Asia's longest-running insurgencies.
The government has been trying to forge peace with the leftist rebels since 1986 but the on-off talks have faltered many times in the past.

Duterte, during his visit to a military camp in Lucena City in Quezon, said he demanded an immediate explanation from the CPP in connection with the incident in which one was killed and another three were injured.
Duterte said he relayed his message to the NDF that he wants the CPP to make it clear if they are serious about the peace negotiations and if they have control over their armed men on the ground.
The president said the members of the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) are part of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
Duterte also said that he expects disciplinary actions to be taken against the members of the NPA that were involved in the attack saying that under the government those who violate the law, including members of the police and military, will be penalized when they break the law.
""I demand an answer as to who broke the law, they must be put under disciplinary actions otherwise we don't have a deal. That is my deal,"" he added.
The president declared a unilateral ceasefire during his state of the nation address on Monday as a sign of goodwill and provide a conducive atmosphere to the peace negotiations with the CPP-NPA-NDF that would resume on August 20 to 27 in Norway.
He said apart from the ceasefire the government has already started the process of issuing a safe conduct pass for members of the communist rebels that would participate in the peace talks.
Duterte had urged the military for understanding as he explained anew why he had to declare a ceasefire with the communist group.
He reiterated that apart from his desire for peace, as commander in chief and president of the country he had to think of the welfare of the general public and what is good for everyone.
Duterte said he knows that a lot of the military men and even policemen are resistant to the truce especially after many of their colleagues had died during operations, but there had already been a lot of deaths and the war had already gone too long.
The communist rebellion has killed 30,000 people since 1960s, and the NPA is believed to have fewer than 4,000 men today, down from a peak of 26,000 in the 1980s, according to the military.

MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine 17th Congress opened on Monday its regular session by electing the respective leaders in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Senator Aquilino Pimentel III, a partymate of President Rodrigo Duterte at the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Laban ng Bayan (PDP-Laban), was chosen as the Senate president of the 24-seat chamber.
Southern Philippine province of Davao del Norte Representative Pantaleon Alvarez was elected as the new House Speaker of the over 290 district and party-list representatives.
Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, representative of the Second District of northern province of Pampanga, was also present during the opening of the session in the House.
After nearly five years in detention, Arroyo was released from hospital arrest last week following the decision of the Supreme Court acquitting her of plunder charge for alleged misuse of P366-million intelligence fund of the state-run Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office during her presidency.
Later in the afternoon, a joint session of Congress will be held at the House of Representatives for Duterte's first State of the Nation Address.

MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is set to hold the formal peace talks with the leftist Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) next month, a senior government official said Tuesday.
Presidential adviser on the peace process Jesus Dureza said the talks will be held from Aug. 20 to 27 in Oslo, Norway.
""We look forward to engaging with our counterparts on the other side of the table,"" he said in a press conference in Malacanang, the presidential palace.
Prior to the formal resumption of the peace talks, he said President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered the concerned government agencies, such as the Department of Justice, to work for possible ""temporary release"" of some detained members of the CPP-NPA-NDF who will be participating in the negotiation.
He refused to name yet who will be the detained leftist rebels who might be granted temporary liberty.
During the talks, Dureza said they would discuss the activation of the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees, which provides for the safe conduct pass to some rebels; to affirm the previously signed agreements; and for the possible declaration of ceasefire.
The formal peace talks between the Philippine government and the leftist rebel group bogged down in 2011 under the administration of former President Benigno S. Aquino III.
The CPP-NPA-NDF has been waging war against the government for over four decades.

MANILA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine peace adviser Jesus Dureza hailed Tuesday the decision of the Supreme Court to dismiss the plunder case against former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
""I am elated that justice has been served with this decision,"" Dureza told a news conference at the Malacanang presidential palace.
Dureza, who served during the Arroyo administration, added, ""I rejoice over this decision that had given her what she rightly deserves. This is justice.""
He said he congratulated Arroyo on the phone on his way to the palace, saying he and his wife used to visit her in her detention room inside a hospital in the capital.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said last May that he wants to see Arroyo walk free from her hospital detention cell. Duterte, a lawyer, said Arroyo has been detained for four years without trial.
""She deserves to be released. She has been detained for so long, the trial delayed,"" Duterte said at the time, adding Arroyo is a victim of slow justice.
The Philippine Supreme Court acquitted Tuesday former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of plunder, granting the former leader's plea to drop the case against her.
The High Court's ruling paved the way for Arroyo, 69, to walk out of the Veterans Memorial Medical Centre, where she has been detained since October 2012.
Theodore Te, a spokesman for the court, told a news conference that the Supreme Court, voting 11-4, annulled the criminal case against Arroyo for ""insufficiency of evidence.' He said the court also ordered the ""immediate release of the detained"" former president.
Arroyo is currently a member of the Philippine House of Representatives having won the May elections for another term.
The Ombudsman filed the plunder case against Arroyo and nine other former government officials who allegedly misused some P366 million (7.8 million U.S. dollars) lottery funds of the state-run Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office from 2007 to 2010.
Arroyo is the second Philippine president to be jailed for plunder.
In 2001, ousted President Joseph Estrada was also jailed after anti-graft court convicted and sentenced him to life in prison in 2007. Estrada was later freed after Arroyo pardoned him.
Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said the Duterte administration recognizes the Supreme Court's independence and it will abide by its decision.
Arroyo's husband, former First Gentleman Jose Miguel Arroyo, welcomed the high court's ruling.
""The dawn of a new administration has brought about new hope for great positive change, which includes freedom from false and malicious accusations and unceasing lies and disinformation,"" he said.
Arroyo said they support the new government on its fight against criminality, corruption and its economic and political reforms that ""will surely usher in new golden age for our country and people.""
After serving as president for nine years until 2010, the former president ran as representative in her province. She has been reelected as congresswoman in the May polls for the third time even if under hospital arrest.
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier admitted that he offered pardon for Arroyo, which the latter declined because it would be considered as admitting on the accusation hurled against her.

MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte
said on Monday his administration will not honor international
agreements which bind the country to limit its greenhouse
emissions.

Duterte believed that wealthy countries were ""trying to stymie
us with an agreement,"" which provides certain greenhouse gas
emissions need to be maintained even by small nations, like the
Philippines.

The president made the remarks during a sendoff ceremony for
Filipino athletes who will compete in the Olympics Games in Rio de
Janeiro on Aug. 5-21.

He recalled that an ambassador, whom he did not name, reminded
him about the commitment made by the Philippines to lessen
emissions and the carbon footprints.

But he told the ambassador: ""You who have reached your apex and
along the way spewed a lot of contaminants and emissions and went
ahead in destroying the climate, good for you.""

""We are here, we have not reached the age of industrialization.
We are going into it. But you are trying to stymie us with an
agreement (telling us) that 'you will maintain the present
emission.' I said, 'that's stupid',"" he stressed.

Duterte said he will not honor the agreement, whose signature
was not his but ""somebody else's.""

The Philippines under former President Benigno S. Aquino III
made a commitment last year that it will reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 70 percent by 2030 in solidarity with other nations
that will provide support in terms of finance, technology and
capacity building.

The new government has asserted that the Philippines can not
ditch coal as one of the energy sources for the country's
electricity requirements.

The Philippine government has just approved 29 more coal-fired
plants on top of the 17 already existing in the country.

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The award of the South China Sea arbitration is nothing but a result of the ""political manipulation"" by Washington, a U.S. expert told Xinhua in a recent interview.
The award issued on Tuesday sweepingly sides with the claims by the Philippines, which unilaterally initiated the compulsory arbitration against China in 2013 in violation of bilateral agreements and international law.
""Well, the result is extremely disappointing because I think the whole thing was manipulation,"" said William Jones, Washington Bureau chief of the U.S. publication Executive Intelligence Review.
""The Philippines, with the backing of the United States, took this to the arbitration court instead of negotiating with China.""
Manila and Washington have their own reasons for taking the case to arbitration. The Philippines hoped to gain more from China while the United States wanted to maintain its hegemony in the region by containing China, Jones said.
He criticized the arbitration as ""a breach of international law,"" because the judges were simply playing politics rather than practicing the law.
""I think I agree with the Chinese position that it's illegal. It was a violation (of international law), it was a political manipulation, and it should not be accepted,"" Jones said.
He added that this case has ""set a bad example"" for the world, by breaching the international law that governs relations between nations.
China has declared from the start that it will not accept nor participate in the arbitration. Neither will it implement the award issued by the arbitral tribunal, which has no jurisdiction over territorial issues and maritime delimitation.
In light of a new president taking office in the Philippines, Jones said he is ""relatively positive"" that the Philippines and China can sit down to talk about resolving their differences.
""Now with Mr. (Rodrigo) Duterte, I think there's a possibility,"" he said.
However, Jones said Washington holds the key to the success of such talks, but that he doubts its willingness.
He blasted Washington for its ""confrontational rhetoric"" on the South China Sea issue, trying to play the role of ""referee.""
Jones also warned Washington against trying to be an ""enforcer"" of the arbitration ruling, by sending more warships to the South China Sea to conduct ""freedom of navigation"" operations in waters concerned.

""I am compelled by my sense of duty to tell you the police who contributed to the deterioration of law and order in this country,"" Duterte said in an impromptu speech at the 69th anniversary of the Philippine Air Force in Clark Freeport in Pampanga.
""At this time I order them being relieved from their assignments and report to the (Philippine National Police) chief Director General (Ronald de la Rosa)."" Duterte said.
Duterte said: ""We have long suspected (there are a lot of police officers involved in drugs). I am not ready yet with the other branches of government, agencies like Customs. I still have to validate; I have no raw information.""
But on the five generals, Duterte said their names have come up ""after so many validations.""
The president has waged a war against criminals, especially drug lords.
Again, he urged policemen or officials not to engage in illegal drugs ""because you will place yourself in the line of fire.""
He has vowed time and again to kill those who are involved in the drug trade, saying these criminals are killing the youths and destroying the country.
The crackdown on illegal drugs has intensified since Duterte, who also offered a multi-million bounty for the capture or death of drug lords, won in the May elections.
He said the campaign against drugs will continue, hoping the campaign will be a success after six months.

Acting based on derogatory information, the Customs Anti-Illegal Drug Task Force (CAIDTF) confirmed the arrival recently at the Manila Post Office of 2,009 pieces of orange tablets, which was positively found to contain three methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) -- a dangerous drug under Republic Act No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).

""I am not satisfied,"" Duterte said in a speech during his visit in the central city of Tacloban, the hardest hit area when Haiyan ravaged the country on November 8, 2013.
""It is this kind of service that I came here for. I'm really, I'm sorry I said, I do not want to offend anybody. I am not satisfied,"" he said.
Duterte ordered Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Mike Dino to accelerate the implementation of projects, particularly the housing units for the typhoon victims.

Judy Taguiwalo, Department of Social Welfare and Development secretary (DSWD), said most of the funds, both from local and international donors, received for Haiyan survivors were allotted for Emergency Shelter Assistance (ESA).

MANILA, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday to allow the remains of ousted former President Ferdinand Marcos to be buried in the heroes' cemetery in Manila, hopefully ending more than two decades of dispute that continued to divide Filipinos.
Voting 9-5, court spokesperson Theodore Te told a news conference that the court dismissed all petitions to ban Marcos burial in the cemetery.
The high court found that ""there is no law that prohibits the burial of Marcos in the heroes' cemetery,"" and that Marcos qualifies to be interred in the cemetery because ""he was a former president, he was a commander in chief, he was a former soldier, medal of valor awardee, former legislator, (and) secretary of national defense,"" Te said.
Moreover, the court said that Marcos ""had not been convicted of crime involving moral turpitude.
""The court said that the cases cited by the petitioners which were cases abroad were all civil in nature and therefore he has not been convicted by any final judgment involving moral turpitude,"" Te said.
The Marcoses hailed the ruling. Former Senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr. thanked President Rodrigo Duterte, a close friend and ally of the Marcoses.
""Our family will forever be thankful for his kind gesture,"" he said.
""It is our sincerest hope that this will lead the nation towards healing as we endeavor to move the country forward to give every Filipino a better life,"" said Marcos Jr.
Marcos Jr. also added that the Marcos family is ""deeply grateful"" to the Supreme Court for its decision to allow the burial of Marcos at the cemetery.
""Once again, the Supreme Court has taken a magnanimous act to uphold the rule of law,"" he said.
Marcos Jr. said his family will start finalizing the date for his father's interment.
An anti-Marcos petitioners said in a statement that they are ""disappointed, heartbroken and outraged by the decision.""
""With this decision, the courts have tramped on the graves of the true heroes of this country. They have trampled on the memory of those who have died defending our freedom, our rights, and our very identity as Filipinos,"" the anti-Marcos group said.
The group added that the Supreme Court has ""subjected those who suffered and died under Marcos's orders to a new death once again, robbing them the sole consolation they have had: that their deaths were not in vain, that they died protecting a nation, that they died heroes.""
Anti-Marcos groups, most of them torture victims locked up in jails when Marcos imposed martial law in 1972, filed a petition before the court to oppose the burial, arguing that Marcos is not a hero and does not deserve a plot in the cemetery reserved only for heroes.
They further argued that thousands of Filipinos suffered and were stripped of their rights during the Marcos dictatorship.
Citing a law that allows the interment of presidents and soldiers without distinction on whether they were heroes or not, the Marcos family and their lawyers argued that Marcos is a former president and soldier and therefore is eligible for ground burial at the cemetery.
Marcos loyalists led by Marcos' daughter, Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos and anti-Marcos protesters held separate rallies outside the court when the verdict was announced.
Last Sunday, former President Benigno Aquino, whose father was incarcerated by Marcos, attended an anti-Marcos prayer-cum-concert rally to remind the people about the oppressive Marcos rule. He described a burial of Marcos among heroes as ""desecration"" of the national heroes' cemetery.
The next day, Imee Marcos, lit candles, fingered her rosary and led a prayer vigil in front of the high court. She insisted that her father has the right to be buried in the cemetery.
""Let's bury Marcos so the country will heal, become united, and the Philippines would be able to move on,"" she told reporters.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a close friend and ally of the Marcoses, has given the go-ahead for the body of disgraced Marcos to be buried in the Heroes' Cemetery.
Marcos's embalmed body is currently on display in his home city of Batac in Ilocos Norte province, north of Manila, a known bailiwick of the Marcoses.
Marcos was elected in 1965, but declared martial law in 1972. Millions of Filipinos took to the streets in February 1986, deposing Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The Marcoses was forced to flee to Hawaii where the elder Marcos died in 1989. His body was bought back to the Philippines in 1993.
The Marcos family has long lobbied for an honorable burial in the heroes' cemetery. But the anti-Marcos and human rights groups had vehemently opposed the plan, saying the disgraced leader does not deserve a military honor and a plot in the hallowed ground. Enditem

He made the remarks at the Malacanang presidential palace during the signing ceremony of an executive order creating an expanded body that will draft a revised law to create a new Bangsamoro region.
Last week, Duterte lashed the United States for threatening to stop the sale of the rifles to the Philippine police due to what the U.S. called human rights concerns.

""We can always get them somewhere else. Let's forget about it. (From what I know) it would be arriving in July 2017. I am ordering the police to cancel it. We don't need it,"" he added.

Duterte said that he would rather use the money to promote peace in the country, especially in the southern Philippines.

Malaysia has played a constructive role in helping bring peace and stability to southern Philippines and the two countries are cooperating to confront transnational concerns like piracy among other issues, Jose said.
""The visit hopes to further deepen Philippine-Malaysia ties for the mutual benefit of the two countries and their peoples.""

 Philippine gov't likens Pacquiao's victory on fight against illegal drugs

"|"
MANILA, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government congratulated Sunday Filipino boxing icon Senator Emmanuel ""Manny"" Pacquiao for defeating Jessie Vargas in a bout in Las Vegas as it likened the lawmaker's determination on the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte's seriousness to eliminate illegal drugs.
""Once again, Manny's triumph united and brought joy to our people and our nation,"" Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar said in a statement.
He said the discipline, the determination, and the hard work of ""our People's Champ are truly what make him a National Treasure in Global Sports.""
Pacquiao regained the World Boxing Organization welterweight title via a unanimous decision from the three judges during the fight held at the Thomas and Mack Center Arena.
Aside from Pacquiao, Filipino boxer Nonito Donaire also fought in an undercard bout. But he lost to Mexican Jessie Magdaleno. However, Andanar said Donaire's defeat would not diminish the honors he bestowed to the people and to the flag.
""The courage and grit displayed by our Filipino boxers in Las Vegas are the same qualities we must demonstrate as a nation to rid society of drugs, criminality and corruption,"" he said.
The official said the Duterte administration has been successfully waging a war on these fronts and ""we as a people - emulating our boxers' toughness against all odds - must continue the strong gains as we battle towards victory.""
Statistics released by the police recently said 1,790 drug suspects have been killed since President Rodrigo Duterte launched the campaign when he assumed power on June 30. At least 3,000 others have been reportedly killed by unidentified vigilantes.

 Kerry says confident about U.S.-Philippines ties despite differences

"|"
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday expressed confidence about the future of the U.S.-Philippines relationship, which has soured following Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's tirades against the U.S.
""I am confident about the future of our bilateral relationship, notwithstanding a difference here or there about one thing or another,"" Kerry said at the State Department as he swore in Sung Kim as the new U.S. ambassador to the Philippines.
""The United States continues to place a high value on the close ties that exist between our countries,"" Kerry said. ""We continue to recognize our ironclad commitment to the sovereignty, independence, and security of the Philippines.""
Kerry also expressed the hope to visit the Southeast Asian country before the end of his term as Secretary of State.
In recent months, Duterte repeated lashed out at the U.S., throwing the alliance between the two countries into disarray, after Washington raised concern on the reported extrajudicial killings of drug suspects amid Manila's war on illegal drugs.
The Philippine president also threatened to ""break up"" with Washington. He hit out at the United States, the European Union and the United Nations for using human rights to criticize his campaign to curb the illicit drug menace in the Philippines.
""I will be re-configuring my foreign policy"", Duterte said in a speech before the Jewish Asssociation of the Philippines in Makati City on Oct. 4.
""Eventually I might in my time break up with America. I would rather go to Russia and to China"", said Duterte.

c_135803551.htm|2016-11-03| Philippines' Duterte meets with Muslim rebel leader|"

MANILA, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday that a leader of a separatist Muslim group has agreed to talk peace with the government again.
Duterte broke the news during a news conference after meeting with Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) founder Nur Musuari at the Malacanang presidential palace.
""It is with great happiness that I announce to the nation that Chairman Nur Misuari, our brother who heads the MNLF, has finally decided to just accept my invitation for him to talk to us,"" Duterte said.
He added that Misuari, 77, has obliged to travel from the remote Sulu province to meet with him at the palace.
""There is the pending warrant which is lifted now upon my orders so that we can talk,"" Duterte said, assuring Misuari that ""there was never any intention to deprive you of your liberty.""
Misuari vowed to help Duterte in pursuing peace especially in Mindanao region, home of many Filipino Muslims.
""I cannot reject his invitation because I respect him too much,"" Misuari said, adding he came to the palace to personally thank Duterte for ""restoring my freedom if only partially.""
Misuari had been in hiding since 2013 for allegedly plotting the attack in Zamboanga City. In August 2013, Misuari threatened to declare independence for several regions in western Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago.
In September that year, the Misuari-led insurgents clashed with government troops in the city and nearby villages and took nearly 300 people hostage in the process.
In subsequent battles which lasted about a month, more than 100 people reportedly were killed, including 71 Misuari fighters, civilians and police men.
Over 120,000 residents were displaced as a result of the fighting that left many houses and mosques burned to the ground.
The MNLF signed a peace treaty with government in 1996, which created the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, consisting of four provinces with limited autonomy. However, Misuari criticized the government for reneging on its promise for an autonomy.
The Duterte administration is trying to talk peace not only with Misuari's MNLF but also with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a larger Muslim rebel group that broke out from Misuari's group in the 1980s. It is also negotiating peace with the communist rebels.
An estimated 120,000 to 150,000 people have been killed in the wars between the government troops and the Muslim separatist rebels since the late 1960s, according to government records.
The fighting also displaced millions of Filipinos in the southern Philippines and stagnated development in that region.

MANILA, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday spat out curse words at the United States and even called the Americans ""monkeys"" as he reacted to news reports that the U.S. State Department is halting the planned sale of some 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippine National Police due to human rights concerns.
""Look at these monkeys. They're stopping the sale of 26,000 assault rifles to us. Son of a bitch. There are a lot of airguns. The Americans are fool,"" Duterte said in a speech during the send-off ceremony of 17 Vietnamese fishermen who were caught poaching in waters in September in Sual town, Pangasinan.
Again, Duterte slammed the U.S. for intervening in the Philippines' affairs, adding it was the Americans who started the verbal war.
""Son of a bitch! I'm fuming mad. They started it first,"" Duterte added, recalling how the Americans treated Filipinos like ""a dog on leash"" after ""living in the fat"" of Filipinos during their 50 years of occupation of the Philippines.
Duterte said that he has lost respect for America. ""That's my problem with America. They are rude to us that's why I'm rude to them,"" he said.
He reiterated that the Philippines is a sovereign country and should not be treated like a colony, adding that the U.S. treats the Philippines like a dog on leash that is thrown food if it follows orders from its master. ""In our case, it's in the form of (foreign aids),"" he said.
Duterte cited how the U.S. ""destroyed"" Iraq, ""undermined"" Libya, and now trying to destroy Syria.
""If somebody here could tell me a good rationale, or rationale if you may, tell me if what the U.S. is doing is right. In the case of Iraq, you destroyed a country, killed the leaders. No weapons of mass destruction found,"" he said.
It was the first time that Duterte laced his speech with expletives again after vowing that he would stop swearing after he said God had told him to stop cursing while on a plane from a visit in Japan.

c_135802848.htm|2016-11-03| Feature: Unknown painter of Duterte's official portrait slowly gaining recognition|"

MANILA, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- An unknown, self-taught artist who painted a portrait of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is slowly getting noticed in the media and in the art world.
Mart Henry Bongabong, 31, a college dropout, said in a recent interview that he still could not believe that the portrait he painted is now hanging in the reception hall of the Malacanang presidential palace alongside the presidential portraits of past Philippine leaders painted by famous Philippine artists.
""Never in my wildest dreams did I think that one day my painting, a portrait of a Philippine president, would end up hanging in the historic walls of the palace,"" he told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
Unlike nationally recognized artists, Bongabong managed to hone his skills without the luxury of having an art school background. A lack of finances forced him to drop out of college because his father, a fisherman, and mother, a housewife, could not afford to send all six of their children to school. When he was growing up, he said he helped his father mend fishing nets to help supplement the family's income.
The family moved a number of times in Mindanao, an island in the southern Philippines, to look for greener pastures. When their parents died, the siblings decided to live where they could find work. Bongabong had decided to make Davao City his home after hearing ""a lot of good things"" that Duterte had been doing to keep the city safe.
""I didn't go to a fine arts school. I am just an ordinary artist, a son of a poor fisherman from Zamboanga, yet my artwork is now on display in the palace alongside other Philippine national artists like (Fernando) Amorsolo,"" he said.
Until now, Bongabong said he could not believe that his oil painting on a 30-inch by 40-inch linen canvass of Duterte was selected over works by many more popular painters.
Bongabong's portrait depicts a compassionate president. Bongabong painted Duterte's head just very slightly rose, showing pride yet with a smile on his face. ""I portrayed him as someone who is approachable and humble,"" Bongabong said. ""I guess my hard work paid off.""
Bongabong, knows as Macky to his friends, is virtually unknown in the art world. Except for some friends and clients who go to his fine arts kiosk inside a shopping mall in Davao, Duterte's home city, Bongabong said nobody really knows his work.
""Who would have thought that someone would notice my talent as a painter?"" Bongabong said.
It all started sometime in August when a staff from the Office of the President dropped a note to Bongabong's rented kiosk in a shopping mall in Davao.
""I was nervous when I saw the stationery that said Office of the President Manila. I called the mobile number written on it and heard the good news. I was being asked to do a portrait of our beloved president. I was nervous and excited at the same time,"" he recalled.
Bongabong said the task was scary for someone who has no formal training in painting.
""I could feel the tremendous pressure on my shoulders. But I accepted the challenge. I didn't want my insecurities to get in the way,"" he said.
The Office of the President emailed Duterte's photo to Bongabong ""for guidance.""
For the next 30 days, Bongabong said he was sketching, painting and mixing colors on his palette to create a ""natural"" Duterte. ""I made sure that the colors popped,"" he said, adding that he wanted the painting to be ""alive.""
He considers the portrait painting to be his greatest work so far, earning glowing compliments from the palace. ""I was told my portrait was both natural and vibrant,"" he said.
He added, ""I consider it a labor of love. Every single day for a month I was happy to wake up and paint somebody I know, I respect and look up to. Plus I think the emotions that I put into it, my life struggles and experiences went into every inch of detail with each brush stroke.
On Oct. 16, Bongabong personally presented the portrait painting to Duterte at the Davao international airport before the leader left for his state visits to Brunei and China.
""I cried. I was overwhelmed when I saw him. I was awed. He was very soft-spoken. He even joked that he would commission my team again for more paintings,"" he said.
""It was a gift of love to President Duterte who we consider a tatay (father),"" he said.
After their meeting that lasted several minutes, Bongabong said Duterte invited him for dinner at the palace a few days later. It would be Bongabong's first time to set foot in the official residence and principal workplace of Philippine presidents.
Also invited to the dinner were his two apprentices, Keren Hanhah Golea and sister Krystle Ann Golea who also gave Duterte a charcoal painting of Duterte kissing his mother's hands. Golea's charcoal painting is also now hanging on the walls of Bahay Pangarap just across from the palace where Duterte lives when he is in Manila.
Bongabong remembered his first fleeting encounter with then Davao City Mayor Duterte back in 2013. He said he and his friends went up to him at the mall and requested a photo to which the former mayor readily agreed. Little did he know that three years later he would be invited to have dinner with Duterte at the palace.
He said he is looking forward to the dinner with Duterte. ""I cannot ask for more. If that happens then I will just thank him again for appreciating my work and for giving me the opportunity to paint his portrait. It's a real honor and a privilege,"" he said.
Bongabong has indeed come a long way.
From the rural fishing village of Zamboanga, the bachelor who runs a small art shop in a shopping mall will share dinner with the 71-year-old Duterte, the Philippines' 16th president and the first president from Mindanao.
Duterte is now immortalized in an official portrait that now hangs in the halls of power where artworks of known Filipino artists are also on display.
Bongabong's advice to aspiring painters is encouraging. ""Appreciate what you have and use it. Love your work and keep practicing to hone your skills. Always give it your best. Being poor is not hindrance,"" the artist said.

c_135791961.htm|2016-10-30| 2 militants killed, 8 soldiers wounded in clashes with Islamic fighters in southern Philippines|"

MANILA, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military said Sunday that two militants were killed and eight soldiers wounded in fightings between troops and Abu Sayyaf rebels in the southern Philippine province of Sulu.
Army Maj. Filemon Tan, spokesman for the Philippine armed forces, said in a statement that two Abu Sayyaf fighters were killed in a brief firefight in Indanan, a town in Sulu on Sunday morning, bringing the total number of dead Abu Sayyaf fighters to 38 since the new government launched a renewed offensive against the criminal group in July.
Tan said that eight soldiers were wounded in another clash that broke out in Patikul town, also in Sulu.
He said the military could not say whether there were militants killed in the incident, saying there are still sporadic fighting until around 3 p.m. Sunday.
The military used artillery and attack helicopters in both clashes in a bid to trap the militants, he said.
In the Indanan clash where two militants were killed, Tan said the military recovered an M16 assault rifle, an M203 grenade launcher and an improvised explosive device.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered a military offensive to crush the Abu Sayyaf rebels, saying he has no plan to talk peace with the criminal group engaged in kidnap for ransom, executions, extortions and bombings in the southern Philippines.
Since the military offensive was launched in July, the military said a total of 16 hostages have been ""released."" However, it said that 14 kidnap victims remain in captivity.
At least 15 soldiers were killed and 28 wounded in the military offensive so far, according to military records.
The Abu Sayyaf is believed to be responsible for a spate of attacks and robberies in the southern Philippines, including kidnap for ransom, bombings, extortions, raids of villages in the provinces of impoverished Basilan and Sulu since the early 1990s.
The military said that there are now about 350 active members of the Abu Sayyaf group, the smallest but the most radical of the extremist movements in the southern Philippines.
The group is active in the impoverished region, where minority Muslims have been fighting for self-rule since the 1970s.
Army Col. Rodrigo Gregorio, head of the military task force that focuses on the war against the militants operating in Sulu, said that the offensive will continue.
""The focus military operation will continue until we deal a crippling blow against the Abu Sayyaf and rescue the remaining hostages,"" Gregorio said.

c_135791424.htm|2016-10-30| Commentary: Washington's anxieties in Asia-Pacific region|"
by Xinhua writer Liu Chang
BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- In recent days, Washington seems to be agonizing over the colorful rhetoric of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, while its ""pivot to Asia"" policy faces even more uncertainties.
The United States believes that it has some sort of natural rights to write what outgoing President Barack Obama called ""the rules of the road"" for the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, it wants all nations in the region to observe that same playbook.
Yet without obedient partnerships underpinned by strong economic, military and security cooperation, America's such geopolitical arrangement could go nowhere.
In recent months, Washington has been troubled by a sense of worry.
Since Duterte took office in late June, the new leader in Manila has kept flashing out signals that have perplexed the Americans, if not enraging them. Perhaps the U.S. leaders have now begun to miss the ""good old days"" when former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III was in power.
Now that the Philippines has vowed to send all foreign troops home, including the U.S. forces stationed in the Southeastern Asian country, many are wondering how far Manila would go to push forward its independent foreign policy.
While the Philippines seems to be pivoting away, the bleak picture for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact has also raised qualms of America's allies in the region about Washington's determination and ability to close the deal.
The TPP is the economic magnet Washington tries to use to pull its regional partners together and to bolster its economic leadership in the Asia-Pacific. Its failure to be materialized, which now seems very likely, would sink the re-balance to Asia strategy deep down into the waves of the Pacific.
Though Beijing has repeatedly promised to seek peaceful development, the suspicious and stubborn Washington still tries to counterbalance it.
In his recent article published in the Foreign Affairs magazine, Ashton Carter, U.S. defense chief, criticized Beijing for being ""out of step with where the Asia-Pacific wants to go.""
Considering America's intention to call the shots in the region, the secretary could probably really mean ""where Washington wants to go.""
The rapprochement between Beijing and Manila has gotten on the nerves of the U.S. government. That may explain why U.S. Navy destroyer Decatur intruded earlier this month the waters of China's Xisha Islands in the South China Sea.
At the very root of Washington's growing solicitude are its self-serving and arrogant ambition to maintain global hegemony and worries that its days of being the world's only superpower are in a ticking countdown.
If the United States wants to get rid of the anxieties, it has to find its rightful place in the Asia-Pacific and the wider world, and starts to act more constructively, not coercively. Obsession with the vain dream of building a long-lasting global empire could ultimately turn its nightmares into reality.

TOKYO, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday that he wanted to review a military agreement with the United States.
Duterte, on his final day in Japan, reiterated his stance that he intended to review the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement inked with the United States in 2014, which allows U.S. troops to maintain military bases in the Philippines and rotate its troops in and out.
""Maybe, I will review the EDCA and ask them (the U.S. military) one of these days to leave the country,"" he was quoted as saying.
Duterte also said the joint military exercises held between the Philippines and the U.S. have not been as beneficial to Manila as they should be.
During the president's three-day visit, Japan and the Philippines have agreed to enhance cooperation in a number of areas, including Japan providing the Philippines with infrastructural support.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan would assist Duterte's war against drugs by helping out with addicts' rehabilitation.
Abe, after a meeting with Duterte a day earlier, said the Philippines will serve as ASEAN chair next year and Japan would provide its utmost support in this regard.
Duterte gave recognition to Japan as being an important dialogue partner for ASEAN.
